Look for rare naga called Prince Nazjak that drops Tidal Charm trinket, this is a very strong pvp trinket for all classes. 
He can be in one of the boats or in the ruins. Use a /target Prince macro and use it when you quest here to find him easier.

Turn in [QT778] and [QT715], [QT716] if you got the items for it.
Turn in [QT732].
<WEAPON UPGRADE> Now would be a perfect time to do a full Uldaman run, since there are so many quests for Uldaman it can be hard to complete all of them without wasting too much time. 
I recommend you read my Uldaman guide and follow it for a smooth run that will complete all the important quests. 
Last boss also drops two very good 2h weapons which will be very good for us and can last all the way to 60, so doing Uldaman is a very good idea.
Do Uldaman or grind in Badlands to 42,5.

Accept quests [QA621], [QA587], [QA604], [QA348], [QA617], [QA609], [QA576] and [QA614].
Go east to the shore. Kill pirates.
When here, look for a small green bottle in the sand, it can contain Carefully folded Note, keep it for later.
Collect the Bloodsail charts and Order on the southern end of the beach at the small camp.
If this area is too crowded and you can't complete the kill quest for pirates there is another area with some Swashbucklers southwest of the Gurubashi Arena.
Look for people to kill Gorlash for [QC614], if you can't find a group, try to do it later.
If you still have that group, ask if they want to do [QC348 Stranglethorn Fever]. This is quite hard and you might need more than two people depending on your classes or levels.
Continue north on the beach and kill Zanzil Zombies on the beach for [QC621]. 
Also Kill Chucky Ten Thumbs for [QC609].
Go west towards Gurubashi Arena and into the other Zanzil camp, kill Maury and Jon-Jon while finishing up Zanzil's Secret.
Go into the basilisk cave and look for rare spawn Scale Belly, can drop a nice 2h sword with a unique look which can be worth a lot of gold later on.
(ELITE)Try to get a group for killing Bhag'thera and Tethis. 
Bhag'thera can be soloed if you have some cooldowns but Tethis is very hard. You can skip these now if you can't find a group and do another STV sweep later.

You should be 43 after turning these in.
Go kill naga explorers northwest of Booty Bay for Akiris reed, skip if drop rate is super low and you have competition for kills since there is a limited amount of spawns.
Go kill the Pirate captains on the boats east of Booty Bay.
The captains are a bit higher level, so be careful and kill them alone with no adds or skip for later.
Look for [QC624 Cortello's Riddle] below deck in all the boats, should be up in one of them, it's a scroll lying on the floor.

Turn in [QT617] accept next, turn in [QT608].

[F]Fly Darkshire, then run into Swamp of Sorrows and turn in [QT624 Cortello's Riddle] under the first bridge, accept follow up.
[H]HS back to Booty Bay or if HS is on cooldown run to Nethergarde Keep and [F]fly.
<WEAPON UPGRADE> You should start looking to buy [V] a new BOE weapon now if you didn't get one from Uldaman. 
There isn't really any more weapons you can get until you either do Maraudon Princess runs at around lvl 50, and if you are leveling fast people will probably not have the scepter ready by then. 
The weapons I recommend looking out for are Blade of the Titans and Executioner's Cleaver. 
Expect to pay up to 50g+ for one of them. It may seem much but this weapon will last until 60 if needed so it's definitely worth.

Take boat to Ratchet, fly to [F Theramore].
