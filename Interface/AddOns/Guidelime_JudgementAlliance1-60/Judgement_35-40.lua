Rock Pulverizer weapon upgrade
This part can be counted as a Class Quest for Paladins and should not be done if you are another class (except Warrior if you aren't getting Whirlwind Axe). 
At this point your current weapon will most likely be something like Archeus, or maybe even worse. It's starting to get outdated at this point, and unless you are planning on running all wings of SM soon to get Bonebiter I would suggest you to do this part
t should take around 30 mins solo or faster if you can get some help and you will get a really good weapon.
If you don't do this part you will have to incorporate these quests into the Badlands part yourself when we get there at level [XP 39].
