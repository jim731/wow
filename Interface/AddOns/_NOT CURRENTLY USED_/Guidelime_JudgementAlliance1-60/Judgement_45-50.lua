Our first objective is to complete [QC3442]. 
Kill Heavy War Golems, Magma Elementals and Fire Elementals to get the stuff you need. 
Of course you can also kill the other stuff you have quests for while searching for these like Dark Iron dwarves or spiders, but focus on getting [QC3442] completed first.
When you got Golem oil and Hearts of Flame return to Kalaran and turn in [QT3442], accept [QA3443].

Then fly to [F Ironforge].

[F]Fly back to Thorium Point. 
Now we go down into the Slag Pit below. There are two ways to get there, either you jump down in the hole close to where Kalaran are or you can go around into the central area and take the normal way in 
I recommend jumping down. Use BoP on yourself to avoid falling damage.
Run north in the cave and kill dwarfs until you reach the bigger room with a ramp on your right. 
Turn in [QT3371] at the dwarf on the floor 
Accept [QA3372].
Continue up the ramp. In the next room to your right you have Overseer Maltorius, he's a 50 elite so you probably can't solo him, but we want the plans on the table behind him. You should be able to get these by stunning him with HoJ and looting it since he's a spellcaster, so after the HoJ he will cast a shadow bolt giving you extra time to loot the plans before you get interrupted.
After you looted the Plans run away to the bridge and jump down on your left side and you will enter the Incendosaur cave.
Clear the Incendosaur cave until you kill 20 of them and then leave.
Make your way back up to the surface, go to Kalaran after you completed killing all dwarves and gotten the Thorium plated daggers.
Turn in [QT3443] and accept [QA3452].
Return to Thorium Point and turn in the quests you have completed.

THIS PART WILL INVOLVE SOME ELITE GROUP QUESTS, SKIP IF SOLO AND CAN'T FIND A GROUP FOR IT, CAN ALSO TRY AGAIN LATER ON
Now we need to kill some cultist elites to continue, it's possible to solo the Twilight Dark Shamans you can find to the west outside the cave, just interrupt their heals and you should be fine, the Fire Guards are much harder so avoid them. Getting a group for this will make it much easier. 
If you can't solo them or get a group you can skip these quests for now and come back and do them later, around level [XP 50] and you should have no problems doing it.
Kill a few cultists until you loot Symbol of Ragnaros. If you get a group you can run up the hill next to the cave and you will find a night elf sitting in a cage next to a pool of lava, the best way to do this is to have one party member aggro all the cultists and run away while the other members get the quest, then repeat for all members in the party. 
Accept [QA3377], talk with the night elf and turn it in. Accept the follow up.
The Mysterious Artifact you need for [QC3372] are in the center of the Lava Pool 
To get it jump into the pool and stand on top of the Artifact, then loot it, otherwise you will take lava damage and get interrupted.

Accept [QA3566] This quest is semi hard, you need to fight two 52 elites at the same time, if you can't, skip.
Continue up the ramp and kill Overseer Maltorius.
Return to Thorium Point and turn in [QT7701].
While still in your group, go back to the outhouse where you started in this zone and continue southeast into the mountains 
Here you will find Margol the Rager. Kill him and loot Margol's Horn. Accept [QA3181].
Do [QC3463] This can be done solo quite easily by equipping the Torch and running up to the towers and clicking on the braziers, use bubbles and hoj to your advantage.
Return to Squire Maltrake and turn in [QT3463]
After the RP event, click on the black chest and accept [QA3481], then click on the chest again and turn in [QT3481 Trinkets...].
