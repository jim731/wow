01) Go back to the other Razormane camps up NE (around [G57,25The Barrens]) and do "[QC872 The Disruption Ends]" and "[QC5041 Supplies for the Crossroads]": kill the needed Razormane mobs and loot a Crossroads' Supply Crates (there are multiple locations of these crates). Kreenig Snarlsnout is at ([G59,27], /target).
02) Once done, go SE to Ratchet and accept "[QA865 Raptor Horns]" (next to Ratchet's bank, [G62,38]).
03) At the WANTED sign next to the bank, accept "[QA895 WANTED: Baron Longshore]" ([G63,38]).
04) Go to the Flight Master[P] ([G63,37]) to get the FP, then next to you accept "[QA894 Samophlange]". NOTE: To free up bag space you can destroy the Control Console Operating Manual as it is not needed.
05) Go in the engineering building and accept "[QA887 Southsea Freebooters]" ([G63,36]).

07) Turn in "[QT819 Chen's Empty Keg]" (male orc next to the Plate-n-Chain hut, [G62,38]), accept the next [QA821 part]. Also focus on doing this quest while throughout The Barrens by kill/looting cats, plainstriders and Thunderlizards...
08) Right outside of the Ratchet Inn, accept "[QA891 The Guns of Northwatch]" (up at [G62,39]). NOTE: At the Ratchet Inn you can buy Longjaw Mud Snapper food for really cheap. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.[R]
09) Follow the path south of Ratchet to The Merchant Coast and do "[QC887 Southsea Freebooters]" along with "[QC895 WANTED: Baron Longshore]": kill the needed Southsea pirates and kill/loot Baron Longshore /target, he has 3 possible spawns at the southern most tents (starting at [G64,47]).
10) Go back to Ratchet, and in the engineering building turn in "[QT887 Southsea Freebooters]" (accept "[QA890 The Missing Shipment]") and "[QT895 WANTED: Baron Longshore]" ([G63,36]).

18) South in XRs, accept "[QA899 Consumed by Hatred]" and "[QA4921 Lost in Battle]" ([G52,32]).
19) At this point, I make sure I have 3/4 six slot bags, if I don't, I buy them at the bag [V] vendor /target (the southern most vendor in XRs, [G52,32]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.[R]
