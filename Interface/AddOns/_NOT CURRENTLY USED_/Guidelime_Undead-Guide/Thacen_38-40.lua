13) Go NW under the water at The Vile Reef and do "[QC629 The Vile Reef]": distract the elites so you can loot the Gri'lek the Wanderer tablet ([G25,23]). You may need to kill one or two of them depending on your class. Use Swim Speed Potions and an Elixer of Water Breathing if you can.
14) Go back SE to Grom'Gol and turn in "[QT629 The Vile Reef]" (#8 on map).
15) Go east to the river and do "[QC577 Some Assembly Required]": kill/loot Snapjaw Crocolisks along the river.
16) GROUP 2+ Players: With 2+ players, go east and do the last part of "[QC193 Panther Mastery]" (Elite): kill/loot Bhag'thera /target. This lvl 40 elite black panther has 3 different spawn points (see map). If you cannot do it, you will have more opportunities later in the guide to solo it.
17) Go to Nesingwary's Expedition ([G36,11]) and turn in (if you did it) "[QT193 Panther Mastery]" and "[QT196 Raptor Mastery]", accept the next [QA197 part].

20) Go NE to Mistvale Valley (around [G32,67]) and do "[QC606 Scaring Shaky]" along with "[QC571 Mok'thardin's Enchantment]": kill/loot the Elder Mistvale Gorillas. Very low drop rate for the Aged Gorilla Sinew (but keep grinding until you get it).
21) Run back SW to BB and near the boat pickup turn in "[QT606 Scaring Shaky]" ([G27,74]), accept "[QA607 Return to MacKinley]".
22) On the lower docks, turn in "[QT597 The Bloodsail Buccaneers]" ([G28,76]), accept the next [QA599 part].
23) Go in the cabin (next to the hanging shark) and turn in "[QT607 Return to MacKinley]" ([G28,77]), SKIP "Voodoo Dues" (for now).

26) Next to you on the roof, go to the Wind Rider Master and fly to Grom'gol, Stranglethorn.

29) Go in the Inn and make Grom'gol your new home ([G32,30]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
30) You should be a little over half way to level 40. Now I grind the rest of the way to 40 on Jungle Thunderers (around [G42,27]) or the Venture Co. Geologists (around [G45,21]). These mobs have less armor and die faster. Instead of the grinding, you could get a 5 man group to do the Scarlet Monastery dungeon.
31) Once you are level 40, hearth to Grom'gol. 
32) At the top of Grom'gol's Inn, get on the zeppelin to go to the UC ([G32,29]). You can save a good chunk of time by doing a suicide warp by jumping off of the zeppelin at a certain timing.
33) At UC's Bank ([G66,44]), get the following items out: Fizzle Brassbolts' Letter, (if you can) stack of 9 Blue Pearls, (if you have them) Frost Oil, Gyrochronatom, stack of Elixir of Water Breathing + Swim Speed Potions. And if you have Healing Potion, Lesser Invisibility Potion and a Patterned Bronze Bracers get those out as well. These items are used for easy turn-in quests in the Badlands. And remember to not sell these items to a vendor.
GET NEW ABILITIES) Get new spells/abilities. 
34) If you can afford to, go buy your level 40 mount. It differs depending on your class & race and it costs roughly 90 gold. Check out my Mount Guide on where to find your mount trainer & vendor.
35) Go to the Bat Handler ([G63,49] in the UC) and fly to Hammerfall, Arathi.
36) Build up First Aid. And if you are able to get to skill level 240, go talk to Doctor Gregory Victor at Hammerfall (in the building, [G73,37] in Arathi Highlands) to learn Heavy Mageweave Bandage.
37) IF YOU HAVE "[QC670 Sunken Treasure]": Go SW through Arathi Highlands and then through the hidden path (that starts at [G29,68]). Follow this path (see map). It leads through a cave, then cross the water (use a Swim Speed Potion if you have one) to Faldir's Cove and turn in "[QT670 Sunken Treasure]". Then accept and do the escort "[QC667 Death From Below]": go on top of the ship and fire the cannon to kill the three waves of naga that come in. Once done, turn it in.
38) Run all the way to the Badlands. See map for directions depending on where you are coming from.
