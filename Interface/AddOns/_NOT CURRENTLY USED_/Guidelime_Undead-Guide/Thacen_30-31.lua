01) Get the FP SE at Grom'Gol from the Wind Rider Master ([G33,29]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied. 
02) Go north to Nesingwary's Expedition (see the path to take on map) and accept "[QA583 Welcome to the Jungle]" ([G36,11]).
03) Next to you, turn in "[QT583 Welcome to the Jungle]". Accept "[QA195 Raptor Mastery]".
04) Next to you also accept "[QA185 Tiger Mastery]" and "[QA190 Panther Mastery]". NOTE: The "The Green Hills of Stranglethorn" quest requires that you save any Green Hills of Stranglethorn pages you find. These pages can drop from any humanoid mob in STV. You will need one of each of the following pages: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27. I recommend mailing them to your alt for storage. Once your alt collects all the pages, mail them back to your main. You can also find these pages in the AH or from other players. You don't need to accept the quest to get the page drops, so accept and turn this in if you get all the pages. You will return to STV numerous times in the future for more chances to find the pages.
05) Right around Nesingwary's Expedition camp to the SW, do "[QC185 Tiger Mastery]": kill 10 Young Stranglethorn Tigers (around [G35,10]).
06) Go back to Nesingwary's Expedition camp and turn in "[QT185 Tiger Mastery]" ([G36,11], #2 on map), accept the next [QA186 part]. NOTE: At the camp, you can get repaired/resupplied from Jaquilina Dramet.

08) Just SE do "[QC186 Tiger Mastery]": kill 10 Stranglethorn Tigers (around [G47,14]).
09) Go back to Nesingwary's Expedition camp and turn in "[QT190 Panther Mastery]" and "[QT186 Tiger Mastery]" ([G36,11], #2 on map), accept the next parts to these quests.
10) Go west and do "[QC191 Panther Mastery]": kill 10 Panthers (up around [G30,10]).
