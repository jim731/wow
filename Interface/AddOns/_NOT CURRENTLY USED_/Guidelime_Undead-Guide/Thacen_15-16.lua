01) Go west into Stonetalon Mountains and do "[QC6548 Avenge My Village]": kill the needed Grimtotem taurens (around [G81,90]). TIP: Kill the Grimtotem Sorcerers first as they do a lot of damage.
02) Once done, go back and turn in "[QT6548 Avenge My Village]" ([G35,28]), accept "[QA6629 Kill Grundig Darkcloud]".
03) Go back into Stonetalon, to the path that goes up into Grimtotem post (starting at [G76,89]).
04) Do "[QC6629 Kill Grundig Darkcloud]": kill 6 Grimtotem Brutes and also kill Grundig Darkcloud /target, he is standing on the steps outside the hut ([G74,86]).
05) Accept and do the escort quest there ("[QC6523 Protect Kaya]" [G73,85] in the hut).\\TIPS: Make bandages during the escort. When reaching down to Camp Aparaje, kill the Ruffian behind the big totem before the final fight starts. Try to keep aggro off of Kaya Flathoof, as she has low HP.  Kill the Sorcerer first that pops out during the one battle you have to fight. If it's too hard for you, skip it.
