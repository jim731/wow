[D A guide created by T H A C E N#9446\Based on Joana's Speed Leveling guide https://www.joanasworld.com]
01) At the bottom of the path into Un'Goro Crater, go up the hill next to the waterfall and accept "[QA4289 The Apes of Un'Goro]" and "[QA4290 The Fare of Lar'korwi]" ([G72,76]).
02) Go north a bit and do "[QC4290 The Fare of Lar'korwi]": loot the big Fresh Threshadon Carcass lying on the ground ([G69,57]). NOTE: You must click it where the neck meets the body.
03) Grind north to the entrance of Marshal's Refuge and accept "[QA4243 Chasing A-Me 01]" ([G46,13]). NOTE: On the way to Marshal's Refuge, grind on Bloodpetal plants to start collecting Savage Fronds for a later quest. Also start collecting crystals (the red, blue, green and yellow) scattered everywhere. Kill/loot oozes too!
04) Go up into Marshal's Refuge and accept ALL quests there: From the goblin on top of the hill, accept "[QA4503 Shizzle's Flyer]" ([G44,12]).
05) Move into Marshal's Refuge ([G44,8]) and accept "[QA4492 Lost!]", "[QA4501 Beware of Pterrordax]" (from the Wanted Sign, Beware of Pterrordax), "[QA3882 Roll the Bones]", "[QA3883 Alien Ecology]", "[QA3881 Expedition Salvation]". NOTE: If you have already found A Mangled Journal, accept and turn in "[QT3884 Williden's Journal]".
06) On the east side of Marshal's Refuge behind the hill, accept "[QA4145 Larion and Muigin]" ([G46,9]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
07) Time to do the Un'Goro Grind! NOTES For the Grind:
 - Don't worry about looting the Un'Goro Dirt Piles, you will find enough Un'Goro Soil from mob drops. Also do not sell the Un'Goro Soil to vendors, you will need these for quest turn-ins!
 - Don't worry about looting the Bloodpetal Sprouts, as they are not turned in for any XP.
 - The Dinosaur Bones you need for the quest "[QC3882 Roll the Bones]" will drop from many different mobs as you do the other quests.
 - As your questing, kill/loot any Oozes (slimes) you see, and collect at least 35 Ooze samples, this is for "[QC4294 ... and a Batch of Ooze]". These Oozes are scattered all around Un'Goro Crater.
 - Also while questing, loot 7 crystals of each color (red, blue, green, and yellow) for a later quest. These crystals are scattered all around Un'Goro Crater.
 - The Bloodpetel mobs (plants) drop Savage Fronds, you need to collect 30 of these for a later quest at lvl 59. As you are doing the Un'Goro quests associated with these mobs you should get about half, so grind on these that you see along the way and make sure you have all 30 before leaving Un'Goro Crater.
 - Watch out for the Elite Devilsaurs patrolling around this zone. I highlighted them through out the images so you can be alerted if you are in a danger zone for them.
08) Just south of Marshal's Refuge do "[QC4504 Super Sticky]": kill/loot the Tar mobs around the tar pits.
09) Go NE to Fungal Rock and start working on "[QC4289 The Apes of Un'Goro]": kill/loot the apes (in and outside of the cave). Also go in the cave (entrance at [G64,16]) and then make a right and turn in "[QT4243 Chasing A-Me 01]", then if you have a Mithril Casing with you, accept and turn in "[QT4244 Chasing A-Me 01]". Then accept and do the escort "[QC4245 Chasing A-Me 01]": escort A-Me 01 to Marshal's Refuge, and then turn it in once you get there.
10) Start working on "[QC4145 Larion and Muigin]": kill Bloodpetal Flayers around the north-middle of Un'goro Crater. NOTE: These mobs are also found south-middle as well, so you don't need to finish all of this now, work your way to the next step..
11) Go up on the mountain ledge (ramp entrance at [G55,13]) and start working on "[QC4501 Beware of Pterrordax]" along with "[QC4503 Shizzle's Flyer]": kill/loot the Pterrordax /target. There are only 6 mob spawns here, so clear the area once and move on to the next step..
12) Make sure "[QC4289 The Apes of Un'Goro]" is finished: kill/loot the apes (in and outside of the cave around [G64,16], #2 on map).
13) Do the next part of "[QC4145 Larion and Muigin]": kill Bloodpetal Lashers and Threshers around the NE side of Un'goro Crater. Also, kill/loot any Dinosaurs you see for part of "[QC4503 Shizzle's Flyer]" (don't need to finish it now though). Keep the next step in mind:
14) Go SE and do part of "[QC3881 Expedition Salvation]": under the tent, loot the Crate of Foodstuffs ([G69,36]).
15) Finish up killing the Bloodpetal Flayers for "[QC4145 Larion and Muigin]" by starting below the river (around [G60,47]) and work you way south. Kill/loot any Diemetradon you see as well for "[QC4503 Shizzle's Flyer]". NOTE: Try to avoid the Raptors as you will be grinding them soon with more quests associated with them.
16) Grind your way SE to Torwa Pathfinder on top of the hill by the waterfall and turn in "[QT4289 The Apes of Un'Goro]" ([G72,76]). Accept "[QA4301 The Mighty U'cha]". And turn in "[QT4290 The Fare of Lar'korwi]", accept "[QA4291 The Scent of Lar'korwi]".
17) Just to the west of you at The Marshlands do "[QC4300 Bone-Bladed Weapons]" along with "[QC4291 The Scent of Lar'korwi]": kill/loot raptors and to get the Ravasaur Pheromone Glands you need, run across the egg nests (there is 5 total, see map for locations) and then kill/loot the Lar'korwi Mates that spawn in. Keep the next step in mind:
18) At The Marshlands, at the western most pond, north on it's shore, click on A Wrecked Raft ([G63,69]) to accept "[QA3844 It's a Secret to Everybody]". Then right next to the wrecked raft, under the water, click on A Small Pack to turn in "[QT3844 It's a Secret to Everybody]", accept the next [QA3845 part].

Make a left in the cave and then use your Unused Scraping Vial quest item on the mound in the center of the room. And keep kill/looting the Gorishi bugs until you get the Gorishi Scent Gland (can drop from any of them, but has a low drop rate). These bugs can be found in and outside of the cave.
21) Go south up at the ledges (around [G56,90]) to finish obtaining the Webbed Pterrordax Scales for "[QC4503 Shizzle's Flyer]" along with finishing killing the 10 Pterrordax /target you need for "[QC4501 Beware of Pterrordax]". There is another spot of these mobs (around [G45,89]).
22) Grind NW a bit to the old camp site ([G39,66]) and do the last part of "[QC3881 Expedition Salvation]": loot the Research Equipment (looks like a stack of brown boxes next to a tent).
