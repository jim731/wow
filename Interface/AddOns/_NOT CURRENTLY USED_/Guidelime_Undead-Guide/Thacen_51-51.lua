[D A guide created by T H A C E N#9446\Based on Joana's Speed Leveling guide https://www.joanasworld.com]
01) As you enter Blasted Lands go to the small quest hub (at [G51,14Blasted Lands]). Accept all 5 quests there. These 5 quests requires the following total number of items to complete them. The items needed can drop without needing to accept the quests. The color codes below show where the mobs are at on the images and stars represent rare mobs that may not be there. Work on the rest of this section all at once):
Mob - Total Items Needed - After "[QT2585 The Decisive Striker]" - And then "[QT2603 Vulture's Vigor]"
02) Vulture Gizzards   =14 - 12 - 2
03) Basilisk Brain     =11 - 11 - 11
04) Blasted Boar Lungs =6 - 5 - 5
05) Scorpok Pincers   =6 - 3 - 3
06) Snickerfang Jowls  =5 - 5 - 3
07) While grinding for these items, do "[QC2681 The Stones That Bind Us]": drag the different servants close to their Stone of Binding crystal next to each of them, then kill them along with attacking the crystal as well. This allows you to actually kill the mob and get quest credit. Each of these different servants are located at different parts of the Blasted Lands. See map for locations. If for some reason you cannot solo this quest, it can be skipped.
08) While grinding make sure you get everything discovered for XP (including The Tainted Scar at [G44,56]).
09) As you get these items, you can turn the quests in for a 60 min stat reward that will help you grind faster in Blasted Lands or even for the next section Un'Goro Crater (although they don't stack). I recommend only showing the quests on screen that you want the rewards first. Go to the quest hub (at [G51,14], #1 on map) and turn in all 5 of these quests: "[QT2581 Snickerfang Jowls]" (+25 Strength), "[QT2583 A Boar's Vitality]" (+25 Stamina), "[QT2585 The Decisive Striker]" (+25 Agility), "[QT2601 The Basilisk's Bite]" (+25 Intellect) and "[QT2603 Vulture's Vigor]" (+25 Spirit). NOTE: The follow up quests do NOT yield XP: "Rage of Ages", "Spirit of the Boar", "Salt of the Scorpok", "Infallible Mind", and "Spiritual Domination".
10) While questing in Blasted Lands, you may have came across an item called Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment, turn these in (at [G52,36]) for the quest "[QA3501 Everything Counts In Large Amounts]". NOTE: I have NEVER found a Flawless Draenethyst Sphere for the quest "[QA2521 To Serve Kum'isha]" ..good luck on that. Also, the follow up quest "One Draenei's Junk" is repeatable but yields no XP.
11) Go to the border of Blasted Lands and SoS, to the Fallen Hero of the Horde ([G34,66] in SoS) and turn in (if you did it) "[QT2681 The Stones That Bind Us]", SKIP "Kirith". Accept "[QA2702 Heroes of Old]".
12) Next to you on the other side of the path, turn in (if you have it) "[QT2702 Heroes of Old]" ([G33,66] in SoS), accept the next [QA2701 part]. Then click on the Spectral Lockbox on the ground next to you to turn it in.
13) Hearth to Ratchet. NOTE: If you did not do "The Stones That Bind Us", then abandon the quest.
14) Next to the Bank, go into Ironzar's Imported Weaponry to get repaired/resupplied from Ironzar ([G62,38] in The Barrens). You can destroy any remaining unsellable Blasted Lands beast items you have (or bank them if you want).
15) At Ratchet's Bank ([G63,37]), get the following items out: Violet Tragan, Stone Circle and (if you have it) Mithril Casing (this item may be in your mailbox), this is used for a quest in Un'Goro Crater, and remember to not sell this to a vendor.
16) Go to the Flight Master and fly to Gadgetzan, Tanaris.
17) As you enter Gadgetzan (next to the crane, [G52,27]), accept "[QA4504 Super Sticky]".
18) At Sprinkle (by the NW hut, [G51,27]), turn in "[QT2641 Sprinkle's Secret Ingredient]". Wait a few seconds (do next step while waiting) then accept "[QA2661 Delivery for Marin]".
19) In the hut next to you, turn in "[QT4494 March of the Silithid]", accept "[QA4496 Bungle in the Jungle]".
20) Next to the AH, from Marin Noggenfogger ([G52,29]), turn in "[QT2661 Delivery for Marin]". NOTE: "Noggenfogger Elixir" takes up to a minute for the NPC to make the item for you, it does not yeild any XP, so do this when you are not in a hurry (such as after level 60). The Noggenfogger Elixir item is used for fun and can be stored in the bank when you want to use it.
21) Head south to the Broken Pillar and turn in "[QT3444 The Stone Circle]" ([G53,46]).
22) Go SW into Un'Goro Crater (entrance at [G27,52] in Tanaris)...
[NX 51-53 Un'Goro Crater]
