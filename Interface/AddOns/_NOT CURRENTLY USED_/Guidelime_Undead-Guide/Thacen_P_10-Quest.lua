01) Go upstairs in Brill's Inn and accept (if it's available) "[QA5659 Touch of Weakness]" ([G62,52Tirisfal Glades]).  Also learn your level 10 spells/abilities.
02) Then go down into the Under City (UC). (entrance at [G63,74] in Tirisfal Glades)
03) While in the UC, you can learn new weapon possibilities at the Weapons Master ([G57,33]), if you can afford to do so.
04) Go NW and up in the War Quarter, turn in (if you have it) "[QT5659 Touch of Weakness]" ([G49,17]).  You now have Touch of Weakness (R1)!  CLASSIC WOW:  You will simply need to talk to your trainer to learn this new ability.
05) Exit the UC through the sewer (entrance west in UC, [G46,44]).
06) As you exit the sewer, go down to the tower and do "[QC427 At War with the Scarlet Crusade]": kill the needed mobs and Captain Perrine is in the watchtower ([G51,68] in Tirisfal Glades).  NOTE:  "Proof of Demise" does not need to be completed now.
07) Hearth or go back to Brill.
