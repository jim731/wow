30) Grind NW to Twilight Base Camp and do "[QC8279 The Twilight Lexicon]": kill/loot the 3 named mobs. First one is Twilight Keeper Havunth /target. This orc patrols around the Twilight Base Camp ([G40,47]). You could wait until he goes out in the open to avoid other adds. See next steps for the other two:
31) Grind west to Twilight Post and kill/loot Twilight Keeper Mayna /target (female human, [G26,37]). NOTE: Feel free to grind on the Twilight mobs here to obtain Encryped Twilight Texts. You will need 10 for a future quest and you will have one more opportunity in the next step to get some more:
32) Go south to Twilight Outpost and kill/loot Twilight Keeper Exeter /target (red armored human with fiery sword, [G16,86]). NOTES: You can avoid Hive'Zora & the Alliance camp by hugging the west side of Silithus mountains. Also keep grinding on the Twilight mobs until you get 10 Encryped Twilight Texts, this will be used for an easy turn-in quest later.
33) Go right behind Bronzebeard Encampment to the mountain entrance ([G43,91]) and try to do "[QC8283 Wanted - Deathclasp, Terror of the Sands]" (Elite): kill/loot Deathclasp /target. This level 59 Elite scorpid is soloable but could give you some troubles. If you cannot solo it, or find a group to help you, then it can be skipped. (See Video)
34) Also at the same area of Deathclasp, do "[QC8282 Noggle's Lost Satchel]": loot Noggle's Satchel (yellow sack on ground, [G44,91]). (See Video)
35) Grind east to Ortell's Hideout (small cave) and turn in "[QT8279 The Twilight Lexicon]" ([G67,70]), accept "[QA8287 A Terrible Purpose]". Also accept, and then turn in "[QT8323 True Believers]". Also this quest is repeatable, but no additional XP.

37) Go up in Cenarion Hold and in the building, turn in "[QT8287 A Terrible Purpose]" ([G49,34]).
38) As you exit the building, make a left and go all the way to the top of the tower and turn in (if you did it) "[QT8283 Wanted - Deathclasp, Terror of the Sands]" ([G51,34]).
39) Hearth to Orgrimmar. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
40) In Orgrimmar, go to the Bank ([G50,70]) and get the following items out: Extended Annals of Darrowshire and your stack of 30+ Bone Fragments. Also, (IF you still need to), get out: 30 Savage Fronds, 30 Dark Iron Scraps. NOTE: 30 Core of Elements should already be in your inventory, if not get them out too. You can put into the bank any remaining Encrypted Twilight Text you may have.
41) Leave Orgrimmar south and get on the zeppelin ([G51,14] in Durotar) to go to The Undercity. You can save some time by doing a suicide warp by jumping off of the zeppelin at a certain timing.
42) Once at the UC, go down in The Apothecarium and turn in "[QT4642 Melding of Influences]" ([G48,73]).
43) Go up to the Bat Handler ([G63,49]) and fly to Light's Hope Chapel, Eastern Plaguelands.
44) Once at Light's Hope Chapel, go in the Inn and from the female human sitting at the table, accept and turn in [QT9128 The Elemental Equation] ([G81,58]).
45) Also in the Inn from Rohan (in purple standing near the entrance), accept and turn in "[QT9126 Bonescythe Digs]".
ONLY do the following 3 if you still need to:
46) Back in the Inn from Korfax (human with black hair), accept and turn in "[QT9131 Binding the Dreadnaught]".
47) Also in the Inn from Huntsman Leopold (balding male standing near the entrance), accept and turn in "[QT9124 Cryptstalker Armor Doesn't Make Itself...]".
48) Just outside of the Inn on your left, accept and turn in "[QT9136 Savage Flora]" ([G81,59]).
49) Outside at the campfire / tent, turn in "[QT5210 Brother Carlin]" ([G81,60]), accept "[QA5181 Villains of Darrowshire]". Make sure you are repaired/resupplied. NOTE: "Heroes of Darrowshire" (and all follow up quests) is a quest chain you could do if you have a group, and it's worth doing, especially later when you get the chance.
50) Go west to Blackwood Lake and do "[QC5181 Villains of Darrowshire]": loot Horgus' Skull under the water (look for the purple glow, [G51,50]). See next step for the other item to loot:
51) Go south to The Infectis Scar and loot Shattered Sword of Marduk ([G54,66]). Look for the pink glow.
52) Go back to Light's Hope Chapel at the campfire / tent and turn in "[QT5181 Villains of Darrowshire]" ([G81,60], #1 on map).
53) Go SW to Corin's Crossing (around [G60,68]) and grind on the mobs there until your Hearthstone cooldown is up, then Hearth to Orgrimmar. Also, another decent grinding spot is The Noxious Glade (around [G82,42]). ALTERNATIVELY: If you did not do "[QC6133 The Ranger Lord's Behest]", then you could try that now: Go north to Quel'Lithien Lodge (entrance at [G51,21]) and kill the needed blood elf mobs and go into the lodge, make a right, then loot the Quel'Thalas Registry (book laying on a bench, [G52,18]). You may need to distract the mobs in the lodge, grab the book and run out some how. If you still cannot solo this, or find help then it can be skipped. Also, if you can find a group you can do "[QC6135 Duskwing, Oh How I Hate Thee...]": kill/loot Duskwing /target. This lvl 60 Elite bat patrols just above The Marris Stead. And, again with a group: "[QC6136 The Corpulent One]", Borelgore /target (lvl 60 Elite, around [G58,32]). These get accepted/turned in at The Marris Stead ([G26,75]).
