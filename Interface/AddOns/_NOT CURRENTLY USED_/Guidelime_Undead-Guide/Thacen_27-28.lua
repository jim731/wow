01) Once at Sun Rock Retreat, at the blood elf, turn in (if you did it) "[QT1088 Ordanus]" ([G46,60]), SKIP "The Den" (Group quest).
02) From the tauren next to the Inn, accept "[QA6283 Bloodfury Bloodline]" ([G47,61]).
03) Go in the Inn next to you and make Sun Rock Retreat your new home from the Innkeeper ([G48,62]).
04) Go to the path SW in Sun Rock Retreat and continue following it SW into The Charred Vale and do "[QC6283 Bloodfury Bloodline]" (Elite): kill Bloodfury Ripper (lvl 26 elite, [G31,62], /target) (See Video).
05) Make sure you are at least 2 bars away from level 28 (or 1 bar away if you did not kill Bloodfury Ripper). Grind on any mobs at The Charred Vale until you are. Then Hearth to Sun Rock Retreat.
06) Just outside of the Inn, turn in "[QT6283 Bloodfury Bloodline]" ([G47,61]).
07) Go to the Wind Rider Master ([G45,60]) and fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore.
08) East at the Bonfire, turn in "[QT1195 The Sacred Flame]" ([G55,51] in TB), accept the next [QA1196 part].
09) Get your level 28 spells/abilities.
10) Go to TB's Inn and make Thunder Bluff your new home from the Innkeeper ([G46,65]).
11) If you still need to upgrade to Heavy Wool Bandage (requires First Aid skill 115), then go to the top of The Spirit Rise to the First Aid Trainer ([G30,21]) to get that. You don't necessarily need to learn Silk Bandage yet, as you can save your Silk Cloth until you get the book to advance to Expert First Aid later.
12) Go to the Wind Rider Master at the top of the tower in the middle of TB ([G47,50]) and fly to Freewind Post, Thousand Needles.
