You can Unstuck(Hearth on CD) or Die here but you generally want to kill very shortly after reaching Barrens so might be an idea to just grind on your way while running instead.
Set your [S] Hearthstone to Crossroads
You should now be around lvl 14 and a half at this point which will make most of the barrens much easier especially with trained 14 skills.
