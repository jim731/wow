[D A guide created by T H A C E N#9446\Based on Joana's Speed Leveling guide https://www.joanasworld.com]
01) Once at Revantusk Village, on the docks accept "[QA7815 Snapjaws, Mon!]" and "[QA7816 Gammerita, Mon!]" ([G80,81]).
02) Turn in (if you haven't yet) "[QT7842 Another Message to the Wildhammer]" (requires the 10 Long Elegant Feathers) ([G79,79]). Accept "[QA7843 The Final Message to the Wildhammer]".
03) Go in the Inn and accept "[QA7840 Lard Lost His Lunch]" ([G78,81]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied. NOTE: Maintain hearthstone with Orgrimmar!
04) Just north of Revantusk Village along the shore, do "[QC7815 Snapjaws, Mon!]" along with "[QC580 Whiskey Slim's Lost Grog]": kill Saltwater Snapjaws (turtles) and loot the Pupellyverbos Port (blue bottles on the ground). Do the next step as well at the same time as these:
05) Do "[QC7816 Gammerita, Mon!]" (Elite): kill/loot Gammerita /target. This lvl 48 Elite turtle patrols up and down the shore line.
06) Go north and right underneath the waterfall ([G81,47]), loot Cortello's Treasure chest to turn in "[QT626 Cortello's Riddle]" (14 slot bag along with 6100 XP)!
07) Go to the little island NE and do "[QC7840 Lard Lost His Lunch]": loot Lard's Picnic Basket ([G85,41]) and then kill/loot the waves of mobs that spawn until you get Lard's Lunch from one of them. It should drop from the first one you loot.
08) Go up the path (starting at [G76,62])...
09) You will be upgrading First Aid soon to either Runecloth Bandage (260 skill), and/or Heavy Runecloth Bandage (290 skill) at Hammerfall soon, so at this point make sure you have enough Mageweave Cloth to hopefully get to First Aid skill of 290. If you need to, keep grinding the Vilebranch trolls around The Altar of Zul (around [G48,67]) to obtain the Mageweave Cloth you need so you can achieve this.
10) Go west to Valorwind Lake ([G41,59]) and do "[QC2641 Sprinkle's Secret Ingredient]": under the water loot a Violet Tragan (mushroom).
11) Go NW to Aerie Peak (Alliance town) and do "[QC7843 The Final Message to the Wildhammer]": use the Final Message to the Wildhammer quest item at the well in the town ([G14,48]). Watch out, Alliance guards sometimes patrols past the well, so run in, plant the pike and run out when the area is clear of guards and other Alliance players.
12) Go east and clear the mobs out of the area in and around the path (around [G59,51]). Work quickly to get to the next step's escort quest so these mobs are not in the way...
13) While questing in Hinterlands, you may have found an item called OOX-09/HL Distress Beacon, from it accept "[QA485 Find OOX-09/HL!]". If so, go turn this in in the middle of the lake on top of the hill (at [G49,38]). You may have already turned this in, in the past. Then accept and do the escort "[QC836 Rescue OOX-09/HL!]" ([G49,38]): escort the robot chicken /target all the way to the east shore. It's important to keep aggro off of the chicken so it survives. This quest takes roughly [G16,5] minutes. If you fail, it can be skipped.
14) Go south to Revantusk Village and turn in "[QT7843 The Final Message to the Wildhammer]" ([G79,79]).
15) Go in the Inn and turn in "[QT7840 Lard Lost His Lunch]" ([G78,81]).
16) On the docks, turn in "[QT7815 Snapjaws, Mon!]" and "[QT7815 Gammerita, Mon!]" ([G80,81]).
17) Build up First Aid, and see if you need any of the following: Heavy Mageweave Bandage (240 skill), Runecloth Bandage (260 skill), or Heavy Runecloth Bandage (290 skill). If you meet the skill level requirements, then go to the Wind Rider Master and fly to Hammerfall, Arathi and then go to Doctor Gregory Victor at Hammerfall (in the building, [G73,37] in Arathi Highlands) and upgrade what you are able to get. NOTE: My guide will not remind you again to to upgrade First Aid at Hammerfall!
18) Hearth to Orgimmar. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied. Hunters, make sure you are well equipped with bullets/arrows as you cannot get them at Blasted Lands coming up.
19) Go up to the Wind Rider Master ([G45,64]) and fly to Valormok, Azshara.
20) Once at Valormok, Azshara, from Jediga ([G23,51]) turn in the 3 Delivery quests: "[QT3562 Magatha's Payment to Jediga]", "[QT3563 Jes'rimon's Payment to Jediga]" and "[QT3564 Andron's Payment to Jediga]".
21) Go north in Valormok to the Wind Rider Master ([G22,49]) and fly to Ratchet, The Barrens.
22) At Ratchet do "[QC3444 Stone Circle]": just right outside of Liv Rizzlefix's hut (at the entrance [G63,39]), loot Marvon's Chest. Also, go in Liv Rizzlefix's hut and accept "[QA4502 Volcanic Activity]".
23) Stop at Ratchet's Bank ([G63,38]) and put the following items into it: Violet Tragan and Stone Circle. NOTE: If the boat to BB is at the docks already, do this step at BB's Bank instead!
24) Go in the Inn and make Ratchet your new home ([G62,39]).
25) Get on the boat to go to Booty Bay (at the end of the docks, [G64,39]).
26) Once at BB, go up to the hut (at [G28,76]) and turn in any Robot Chicken escort quests you have done, which include: "[QT2767 Rescue OOX-22/FE!]" (Feralas), "[QT648 Rescue OOX-17/TN!]" (Tanaris) and "[QT836 Rescue OOX-09/HL!]" (The Hinterlands). If you were able to turn in all of these quests, then complete and turn in "[QT3721 An OOX of Your Own]" (7,100 XP).
27) Go in the Inn and turn in "[QT580 Whiskey Slim's Lost Grog]" ([G27,77]).
28) Go up in the Inn on the roof and from the Wind Rider Master ([G27,77]) fly to Stonard, Swamp of Sorrows.
29) Follow the main path SW and from the Fallen Hero of the Horde ([G34,66]) accept "[QA2681 The Stones That Bind Us]".
30) Head south into Blasted Lands...
