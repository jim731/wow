[D A guide created by T H A C E N#9446\Based on Joana's Speed Leveling guide https://www.joanasworld.com]
01) Go in the Inn and make Hammerfall your new home from the Innkeeper ([G74,33 Arathi Highlands]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
02) On the balcony next to you, turn in "[QT638 Trollbane]" ([G74,34]), accept "[QA639 Sigil of Strom]". NOTE: This quest requires a group of at least 3 players. While out questing you can see if you can get a group to do this while in Arathi.
03) Go down to Tor'gan ([G75,36]) and accept "[QA671 Foul Magics]" and "[QA701 Guile of the Raptor]".
04) Go west and click on the Shards of Myzrael to accept "[QA642 The Princess Trapped]" ([G62,34]).
05) Go east of Hammerfall and do "[QC642 The Princess Trapped]": kill/loot the Drywhisker (Kobolds), in and outside of the cave (entrance at [G83,36]). TIPS: Look for the tree and rock ([G81,40]), it shows you where the hidden path is to the cave. If you have mining, then mine as many Lesser Bloodstone Deposits as you can. These are used for an Alliance quest only at STV and sell good in the neutral AH.
06) Once done, go to the Iridescent Shards (at the end of the cave, [G84,31]) and turn in "[QT642 The Princess Trapped]", accept "[QA651 Stones of Binding]".
07) If you have 225 First Aid now, then go to Hammerfall and in the building accept and do "[QC6622 Triage]" ([G73,38]): use the Triage Bandage quest item right there in the room on the wounded soldiers (See Video). Once done, turn it in. Your First Aid should boost to 300 max skill. NOTES: You will also be revisiting this Doctor in the future to get Heavy Mageweave Bandage (240 skill), Runecloth Bandage (260 skill), and Heavy Runecloth Bandage (290 skill). You can also destroy the Triage Bandage in your inventory as it is no longer needed. If you were not able to do this quest yet, you will be farming more cloth in Arathi to try again later.
08) Go up the steps in Hammerfall and make sure you are repaired/resupplied. Then take the north exit and go west to the Circle of East Binding and do part of "[QC651 Stones of Binding]": loot the Stone of East Binding ([G67,30]) for the Cresting Key.
09) Go west to Dabyrie's Farmstead and do "[QC1164 To Steal From Thieves]": kill/loot the 3 named mobs. Kill/loot Kenata Dabyrie /target (up in the small house [G56,36]). See next steps for the other 2...
10) Kill/loot Fardel Dabyrie /target (standing outside next to the barn, [G57,39], or in front of the stables [G54,38])...
11) Kill/loot Marcel Dabyrie /target (in the stables, [G54,38]).
12) Go south a bit and do part of "[QC651 Stones of Binding]": loot the Stone of Outer Binding ([G52,51]) for the Thundering Key.
13) Go south and do "[QC701 Guile of the Raptor]": kill/loot Highland Fleshstalkers (around [G52,68]).
14) Go NW to Boulder'gor and do "[QC676 The Hammer May Fall]": kill the Boulderfist Ogres (outside of the mine) and the Boulderfist Enforcers (inside of the mine, [G35,44]).
15) Go north to Northfold Manor (around [G32,29]) and do "[QC671 Foul Magics]": kill/loot the Syndicate mobs. Any of them can drop the amulets.
16) Go west and do the last part of "[QC651 Stones of Binding]": loot the Stone of West Binding ([G25,30]) for the Burning Key.
17) Go right above Stromgarde Keep to discover it for XP (at [G30,56]). GROUP ONLY (3+ Players): If you are with a group of 2 more players you can do "[QC639 Sigil of Strom]": at the east side in Stromgarde Keep (around [G29,61]) kill/loot the Syndicate Prowlers, Conjurors and Magus for the Sigil of Strom.
18) Go slightly east and click on the Stone of Inner Binding to turn in "[QT651 Stones of Binding]" ([G36,57]), accept "[QA652 Breaking the Keystone]" (Elite).
IMPORTANT: Only do this section if you have an Elixir of Water Breathing with you (or if your Undead). If you don't, skip to the next section below.
19) Go SW to the hidden path (that starts at [G29,68]). Follow this path (see map). It leads through a cave, then cross the water (use a Swim Speed Potion) to Faldir's Cove and accept (from the ogre) "[QA663 Land Ho!]" ([G32,83]).
20) On the dock next to you, turn in "[QT663 Land Ho!]" ([G32,81]).
21) Next to you, accept "[QA662 Deep Sea Salvage]".
22) Just east of you at the Bonfire ([G34,81]), accept "[QA664 Drowned Sorrows]" and accept and do the escort "[QC665 Sunken Treasure]": escort Professor Phizzlethorpe to the small cave to the east. You will have to fight two or more lvl 40 water elementals. This quest is not easy but doable. You will need to let enough time pass in order to complete this escort, so try to survive for about a minute or so when the water elementals come to accomplish this.
23) Back at the Bonfire, turn in "[QT665 Sunken Treasure]" ([G34,80], #4 on map), accept the next [QA666 part].
24) Go out west in the water (use an Elixir of Water Breathing potion along with any extra Swim Speed Potions you may have) and do "[QC662 Deep Sea Salvage]" along with "[QC664 Drowned Sorrows]" and "[QC666 Sunken Treasure]": loot the Calcified Elven Gems (use the Goggles of Gem Hunting quest item to help you find these). Kill 10 Daggerspine Raiders and 3 Daggerspine Sorceress. While doing these work your way to the 4 objects you need to loot, first one is Maiden's Folly Log in the middle layer of the boat within a bunch of junk, and its in a cauldron ([G23,85]). See next steps for the other 3:
25) On the same boat you are on and at the same level, go over in the other room and on a ledge next to a crack in the floor (kind of hard to see), loot Maiden's Folly Charts ([G23,1], [G84,5]). (looks like a brown piece of paper).
26) Go over to the other boat and at the bottom touching the floor of the sea, loot the Spirit of Silverpine Log (looks like a white book, [G20,6], [G85,1]).
27) Just above you on the middle layer on the boat you are at and in front of the ship, next to a cannon, sitting on a crate, loot the Spirit of Silverpine Charts ([G20,5], [G85,6]).
28) Go back east to Faldir's Cove and on the dock turn in "[QT662 Deep Sea Salvage]" ([G33,81], #2 on map).

31) Hearth to Hammerfall.
32) On the balcony just outside the Inn, turn in "[QT676 The Hammer May Fall]" ([G74,34]), accept "[QA677 Call to Arms]". Also turn in (if you did it) "[QT639 Sigil of Strom]", SKIP "The Broken Sigil" (for now).
33) Go down to Tor'gan ([G75,36]) and turn in "[QT671 Foul Magics]" and "[QT701 Guile of the Raptor]" (accept the next [QA702 part]).
34) Go down and turn in "[QT702 Guile of the Raptor]" ([G73,34]). Wait a few seconds then accept the next [QA847 part]. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied by the Forge.
35) Go back up to Tor'gan ([G75,36], #3 on map) and turn in "[QT847 Guile of the Raptor]", SKIP "Foul Magics".
36) Grind south to Witherbark Village (around [G67,64]) and do "[QC677 Call to Arms]": kill the needed Witherbark trolls around the village.
37) Grind back north to Hammerfall and up the steps turn in "[QT677 Call to Arms]" ([G74,34]), accept the next [QA678 part]. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
38) GROUP ONLY (3+ players): While doing the rest of Arathi quests, if you happen to run across the lvl 42 Elite Giant named Fozruk /target, you can kill/loot him for "[QC652 Breaking the Keystone]" (Elite). This giant has a large patrol path (see map). Don't intentionally try to find him. If you did kill/loot him, then turn this in (at [G36,58]).
39) Grind SW to Boulderfist Hall and do "[QC678 Call to Arms]": kill the needed Boulderfist ogres. If you still need to do "Triage", then make sure you get your First Aid skill to 225 before proceeding.
40) Hearth (or grind back if its still on a cooldown) to Hammerfall. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
41) On the deck turn in "[QT678 Call to Arms]".
42) GROUP ONLY (3+ players): Only do the Elite quests "Call to Arms", "The Broken Sigil", "The Real Threat" and "Foul Magics" if you are able to get a group of at least 3 players and these can be done at Stromgarde Keep, otherwise skip them. Turn them in once done and my guide will not cover the follow up quests to these.
43) If you have not done the First Aid quest "[QC6622 Triage]" yet, do so now:
(click to show instructions):
44) Go up to the Wind Rider Master ([G73,33]) and fly to Tarren Mill, Hillsbrad. If "Sigil of Strom" or "Breaking the Keystone" is still in your quest book, abandon them.
