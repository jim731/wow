23) Grind your way to the Thistlefur Hold cave (entrance is [G39,31]) killing mobs for "[QC216 Between a Rock and a Thistlefur]". Also, before getting to the cave, make sure Rorgish Jowl /target is dead. He is a rare mob that patrols around (before the cave entrance) making your future escort quest difficult.
