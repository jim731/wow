01) Once at Valormok, accept "[QA3505 Betrayed]" ([G22,51]).
02) Go NE to the hill entrance ([G53,20])...
03) Go up to the top of the hill and accept "[QA3601 Kim'jael Indeed!]" ([G53,22]).
04) Go south to Thalassian Base Camp and do "[QC3601 Kim'jael Indeed!]" along with "[QC3505 Betrayed]": kill the needed Blood Elves, loot Kim'jael's Equipment boxes on the ground and to Find Magus Rimtori's camp (go to [G60,31]).
05) At the same coordinates as previous step ([G60,31], #4 on map), from the Kaldorei Tome of Summoning (book on pedestal), turn in "[QT3505 Betrayed]", accept the next [QA3506 part].
06) At that same spot, do the next part of "[QC3506 Betrayed]": click on an Arcane Focusing Crystal to summon Magus Rimtori and kill/loot her. You may need to face some guards first so be prepared.
07) Go north to the hill entrance ([G53,20], #2 on map)...
08) Go up to the top of the hill and turn in "[QT3601 Kim'jael Indeed!]" ([G53,22]). Accept "[QA5534 Kim'jael's "Missing" Equipment]".
09) Drop down to The Shattered Strand (be careful, its a long drop), then do "[QC5534 Kim'jael's "Missing" Equipment]": kill/loot Spitelash naga until Some Rune drops (low drop rate).
10) Leave The Shattered Strand, (an exit is at [G46,38], see map for more exits)..
11) Go to Valormok and turn in "[QT3506 Betrayed]" ([G22,52]), accept the next [QA3507 part]. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
12) Head east to the hill entrance ([G53,20])...
13) Go up to the top of the hill and turn in "[QT5534 Kim'jael's "Missing" Equipment]" ([G53,22]).
14) At this point you should almost be lvl 54. Grind the rest of the way to level [G54,5] (10 bars into 54) on Blood Elves around Thalassian Base Camp (around [G58,29]). NOTES: Blood Elves are squishy mobs (mobs that have 30% fewer health/armor, than the average mob that level), so they die relatively fast and yield good XP/hour. They also are a good farm spot for Runecloth, which you will need for cloth donations and First Aid. OPTIONAL: Instead of the grinding, you could go do BRD instance instead.
15) Hearth to Orgrimmar.
16) Once at Orgrimmar, go to the Bank ([G49,69]) and get the following items out: 8 White Ravasaur Claws, Tinkee's Letter and Linken's Training Sword. Also get out 60 Runecloth for cloth donation to the Orc faction.
17) Go NE to Magar's Cloth Goods and turn in the 60 Runecloth to the Orc's Horde Cloth Quartermaster ([G64,51]).
18) Go north to The Drag (up in Yelmak's Alchemy and Potions) and turn in "[QT4300 Bone-Bladed Weapons]" ([G56,34]).
19) Go east to The Valley of Honor and turn in "[QT3507 Betrayed]" ([G75,34]).
20) If you need to, get new spells/abilities. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
21) Go SW and up to the Wind Rider Master ([G45,64]) and fly to Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.
22) Head north to Felwood (entrance at [G56,29] in Ashenvale)..
