01) As soon as you get off the boat, turn in "[QT1180 Goblin Sponsorship]" ([G26,74] in STV), accept the next [QA1181 part].
02) Go in the Inn (The Salty Sailor Tavern) and make BB your home from the Innkeeper ([G27,77]). Next to you in the Inn, accept "[QA605 Singing Blue Shards]".
03) Go upstairs in the Inn and accept "[QA189 Bloodscalp Ears]", "[QA213 Hostile Takeover]" and "[QA201 Investigate the Camp]".
04) Stay up on the top of the docks and go over past the Alliance FP to Tan-Your-Hide Leatherworks and accept "[QA575 Supply and Demand]" ([G28,78]).
05) Go back over to the top of the Inn and then go up the steps to Baron Revilgaz on the boat-deck and turn in "[QT1182 Goblin Sponsorship]", accept the next [QA1182 part].
06) Next to you on the roof, go to the Wind Rider Master and fly to Grom'gol, Stranglethorn.
07) In Grom'gol accept the following: "[QA568 The Defense of Grom'gol]", "[QA570 Mok'thardin's Enchantment]", "[QA581 Hunt for Yenniku]" and "[QA596 Bloody Bone Necklaces]". Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
08) REMINDER: The "The Green Hills of Stranglethorn" quest requires that you save any Green Hills of Stranglethorn pages you find. These pages can drop from any humanoid mob in STV. You will need one of each of the following pages: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27. I recommend mailing them to your alt for storage. Once your alt collects all the pages, mail them back to your main. You can also find these pages in the AH or from other players. You don't need to accept the quest to get the page drops, so accept and turn this in at Nesingwary's Expedition ([G36,11]) if you get all the pages. You will return to STV numerous times in the future for more chances to find the pages.
09) Go to the ledges along the shore ([G26,18]) and start working on "[QC605 Singing Blue Shards]": kill/loot Crystal Spine Basilisks. 80% drop rate. There's only 9 mob spawns in the area. If you run out of mobs, you can start working on the next step(s) then come back to this spot. You will also have more opportunities later in the guide to complete this.
10) Go south at Bal'lal Ruins, just off the shore ([G30,20]) then do "[QC189 Bloodscalp Ears]" along with "[QC581 Hunt for Yenniku]" and start working on "[QC596 Bloody Bone Necklaces]": kill/loot the trolls at the ruins. There is another Ruins up NE ([G34,16]) for more mobs. NOTE: "Bloody Bone Necklaces" does not need to be finished now.
