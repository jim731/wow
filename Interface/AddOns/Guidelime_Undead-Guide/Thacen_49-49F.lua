01) Next to the big tent from Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43Feralas]), turn in "[QT3123 Testing the Vessel]", accept "[QA3124 Hippogryph Muisek]". Also accept "[QA3380 The Sunken Temple]".
02) Go in the big tent next to you and accept "[QA7734 Improved Quality]" ([G74,43]).
03) In the hut across the river ([G76,44]), accept "[QA3062 Dark Heart]" (Elite), "[QA3063 Vengeance on the Northspring]" and "[QA4120 The Strength of Corruption]".
04) Go in the Inn ([G75,45]) and make Camp Mojache your new home.
05) Go SW (around [G56,64]) and do "[QC3124 Hippogryph Muisek]": use the Hippogryph Muisek Vessel quest item on any Frayfeather hippogryph corpses. NOTE: (if you still need to) save 10 Long Elegant Feathers for the quest in Hinterlands, and do not sell them to a vendor.
06) Hearth to Camp Mojache.
07) Next to the big tent from Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43], #1 on map), turn in "[QT3124 Hippogryph Muisek]", accept "[QA3125 Faerie Dragon Muisek]".
08) Go west (around [G68,48]) and do "[QC3125 Faerie Dragon Muisek]": use the Faerie Dragon Muisek Vessel quest item on Sprite Darter corpses.
09) Go back to Camp Mojache at Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43], #1 on map) and turn in "[QT3125 Faerie Dragon Muisek]", accept "[QA3126 Treant Muisek]".
10) Do "[QC3126 Treant Muisek]": use the Treant Muisek Vessel quest item on Wandering Forest Walker /target corpses. There is one (at [G74,39]) and another one (at [G73,55]). You can just use these two spawn locations to get the 3 you need, wait for the first one to respawn again (grind on mobs while waiting).
11) Go back to Camp Mojache at Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43]) and turn in "[QT3126 Treant Muisek]", accept "[QA3127 Mountain Giant Muisek]" (Elite). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
12) While questing in Feralas, you may come across an item called OOX-22/FE Distress Beacon, from it accept "[QA2766 Find OOX-22/FE!]". Then turn this in (if you haven't yet) through the small cave (west at [G51,57]) and do the escort "[QC2767 Rescue OOX-22/FE!]". TIP: Before doing the escort, clear the path of yetis to the main path, otherwise this escort can be really tough. Try to keep aggro off of the Robot Chicken /target, as it can die easily. This is also a fairly long escort ([G12,5] minute).
13) Go west to the goblin next to the dock (at [G45,43]) and accept "[QA7003 Zapped Giants]" and "[QA7721 Fuel for the Zapping]". NOTE: "Zapped Giants" and its quest item Zorbin's Ultra-Shrinker is on a 2 hour timer, so work somewhat quickly, but you should have plenty of time.
14) Do "[QC7721 Fuel for the Zapping]" (starting at [G44,38]): kill/loot water elementals, which include Sea Elementals and Sea Sprays (low drop rate). Watch out for the elite giants (you can use the Zorbin's Ultra-Shrinker quest item on them to make them non-elite).
15) Go back to the goblin next to the dock and turn in "[QT7721 Fuel for the Zapping]" ([G45,43], #4 on map). NOTES: "Refuel for the Zapping" does not yield much XP. You can get resupplied from him.
16) Go east (exit at [G46,38]) to Rage Scar Hold (entrance at [G52,32]) and do "[QC7734 Improved Quality]": kill/loot the yeti for the hides. Also keep grinding on the yetis until you get the Perfect Yeti Hide, from it accept "[QA7738 Perfect Yeti Hide]".
17) Go NW to Ruins of Ravenwind (around [G40,14]) and do "[QC3063 Vengeance on the Northspring]": kill the needed Northspring harpies. Also, keep grinding on harpies until the Horn of Hatetalon drops, then use this item for the next quest:
18) Up north in Ruins of Ravenwind do "[QC3062 Dark Heart]" (Elite): use the Horn of Hatetalon quest item at the two big stones ([G40,9]) to summon Edana Hatetalon (lvl 50 Elite), then kill/loot her. She is not terribly hard to solo, but be prepared.
19) Go SW to The Twin Colossals (around [G39,24]) and do "[QC3127 Mountain Giant Muisek]" (Elite) along with "[QC7003 Zapped Giants]": use Zorbin's Ultra-Shrinker quest item on any giant (this removes the elite status), then use the Mountain Giant Muisek Vessel quest item on the corpses.
20) Go south to the goblin next to the dock and turn in "[QT7003 Zapped Giants]" ([G45,43]).
21) LAST CHANCE FOR THE CHICKEN ESCORT
(click to show instructions):
22) Hearth to Camp Mojache.
23) From Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43]), turn in "[QT3127 Mountain Giant Muisek]". Accept "[QA3129 Weapons of Spirit]". Then instead of waiting for the doc, just do the next step:
24) Go in the big tent next to you ([G74,43]) and turn in "[QT7734 Improved Quality]" and "[QT7738 Perfect Yeti Hide]". Also get repaired/resupplied in the tent.
25) Go back to Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43], #8 on map) and turn in "[QT3129 Weapons of Spirit]".
26) To the other side of Camp Mojache under the hut ([G76,44]), turn in "[QT3062 Dark Heart]" and "[QT3063 Vengeance on the Northspring]".
27) Go to the Wind Rider Master ([G75,44]) and fly to Gadgetzan, Tanaris.
