01) Once in Grom'gol, turn in "[QT2932 Grim Message]" ([G32,28]). 
02) If you still need to, now is a good time to do "[QC197 Raptor Mastery]" (Elite): kill/loot Tethis /target (he has 4 spawns, see map). Then turn it in at Nesingwary's Expedition ([G36,11]) and accept and do "[QC208 Big Game Hunter]" (Elite): kill/loot King Bangalash ([G38,35], /target). Then turn that in at Nesingwary's Expedition ([G36,11]).
03) Go to the Wind Rider Master ([G33,29]) and fly to Booty Bay, Stranglethorn.
04) When you land, next to you from Fleet Master Seahorn accept "[QA608 The Bloodsail Buccaneers]" ([G27,77]).
05) Drop down in the Inn and make BB your new home ([G27,77]).
06) Next to you in the Inn, turn in "[QT1118 Back to Booty Bay]".
07) Go in the cabin (next to the hanging shark) and turn in "[QT2874 Deliver to MacKinley]" ([G28,77]).
08) (If you did it) go up in the docks and turn in "[QT2767 Rescue OOX-22/FE!]" ([G28,76]).
09) Go near the end of the docks and accept "[QA614 The Captain's Chest]" ([G27,74]).
10) Go east to the shore and attempt to do "[QC614 The Captain's Chest]" (Elite): kill/loot Gorlash /target. This elite giant patrols up and down the shore (around [G37,70]). You may need to group up with someone, if you cannot do it, it can be skipped/abandoned.
11) Search the shore east of BB for Half-Buried Bottles until a Carefully Folded Note shows up, from it accept "[QA594 Message in a Bottle]".
12) Go to the island east of BB (use Swim Speed if you can plus watch out for the lvl 50 stealthed panthers there) and turn in "[QT594 Message in a Bottle]" ([G39,81]), only accept the next part if you are able to get help from at least one other player (don't attempt to solo it), then you can attempt to do it by kill/looting King Mukla /target (lvl 51 Elite, at [G41,84]). Then turn it in. NOTE: If the Carefully Folded Note item remains in your inventory, you can destroy it.
13) Do "[QC608 The Bloodsail Buccaneers]": kill the 3 pirates in each of the 3 ships. Also find a scroll laying on the ground (can be in any of the 3 ships) called Cortello's Riddle, and from it accept "[QA624 Cortello's Riddle]". Sometimes this scroll can be in the basement of the ships, so search there too. The first pirate to kill is Captain Stillwater down the first flight of stairs in the ship ([G33,88]). See next steps for the other 2:
14) Kill Fleet Master Firallon down the first flight of stairs in the middle ship ([G31,91]). Watch out for Ironpatch in the room before Firallon, take him on alone first.
15) Kill Captain Keelhaul down the first flight of stairs in the last ship ([G29,88]). Make sure you find the scroll that starts "[QA624 Cortello's Riddle]" before leaving this area. NOTE: After accepting "[QA624 Cortello's Riddle]" you can then destroy the scroll that started the quest as it will no longer be used for anything.
16) Hearth to BB, if Hearthstone is still on a cooldown, die on purpose and res at spirit. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
17) Turn in (if you did it) "[QT614 The Captain's Chest]" (at the end of the docks, [G27,74]).
18) Go to the Bank ([G27,76]) and get the following items out: Mire Lord Fungus, 5 Shadow Panther Heart and Deepstrider Tumor. Also get out a 15 stack of Silk Cloth out of your bank, mailbox or AH ([G27,77]), for a later quest.
19) Up in the Inn, from Fleet Master Seahorn turn in "[QT608 The Bloodsail Buccaneers]" ([G27,77]).
20) This is the last time my guide will tell you to turn in "The Green Hills of Stranglethorn" if it is complete. This quest requires that you have the following pages: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27. You can also find these pages in the AH or from other players. If you have all of them, get them out now and go to Nesingwary's Expedition ([G36,11]) and turn this quest in. If you do go turn it in, afterwards go to Grom'gol's Wind Rider Master ([G33,29]) and fly to Kargath, Badlands. Otherwise, skip to next step:
21) Next to you on the roof, go to the Wind Rider Master ([G27,77]) and fly to Kargath, Badlands.
22) Go SW into Searing Gorge (entrance at [G3,62] in Badlands).
