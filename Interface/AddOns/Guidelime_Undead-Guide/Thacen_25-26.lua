01) First off, keep an eye out for the Galak Messenger and kill/loot this centaur when you see him in 1k Needles. He has a very large patrol path. He drops an item which starts "[QA4881 Assassination Plot]", accept it (if you can). But, don't intentionally do this yet, continue on with the next step:
02) Go to the Lift, to go up to Freewind Post ([G47,48] in Thousand Needles).
03) Once up at Freewind Post, by the Bonfire turn in "[QT4542 Message to Freewind Post]" ([G46,51]), accept "[QA4841 Pacify the Centaur]".
04) From the Wanted Poster - Arnak Grimtotem next to the Inn, accept "[QA5147 Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem]" ([G46,51]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
05) On the west side of Freewind Post, accept "[QA4821 Alien Egg]" ([G45,50]).
06) NW at Freewind Post, accept "[QA4767 Wind Rider]" ([G45,49]). Next to you there, get the FP from the Wind Rider Master.
07) Go back down the Lift ([G47,48]).
08) Go just north to Splithoof Crag and do "[QC4841 Pacify the Centaur]": kill the needed Galak Centuar (around [G46,43]).
09) Go up the mountain ramp (entrance is east at [G55,44])...
10) Once you get to the top in the cave, accept and do "[QC1149 Test of Faith]" ([G54,41]). Once teleported, simply jump (or walk) off the wooden plank to complete the quest, then turn it in, SKIP "Test of Endurance" (Elite).
11) Go east and try to do "[QC1153 A New Ore Sample]": kill/loot the Gravelsnout Surveyors or Gravelsnout Diggers until an Unrefined Ore Sample drops. NOTES: The drop rate is about 20%, but there are only a few of these mob spawns all around 1k Needles at the bottom of the pinnacles. You can use /tar gra to help you find these mobs easier. If you can't find the ore sample in time, then this can be skipped for now. You'll have opportunities to try again later. Also, while working on this quest, you can continue working on the steps below...
12) Do "[QC4821 Alien Egg]": loot an Alien Egg. This egg has several possible spawn points (either: [G56,50] - [G52,55] - [G41,60]).
13) Make sure you are at least 2 bars away from level 26, then go get on the Lift to go back to Freewind Post ([G47,48]).
14) At Freewind Post, next to the Bonfire turn in "[QT4841 Pacify the Centaur]" ([G46,51], #3 on map), accept "[QA5064 Grimtotem Spying]".
15) West in Freewind Post turn in "[QT4821 Alien Egg]" ([G45,50]). Accept "[QA4865 Serpent Wild]".
16) Hearth to Camp Taurajo.
17) Turn in (if you did it) "[QT1153 A New Ore Sample]" (north in CT at the Forge, [G45,58] in the Barrens).
18) Turn in "[QT907 Enraged Thunder Lizards]" (accept "[QA913 Cry of the Thunderhawk]"), (if you have it) "[QT885 Washte Pawne]" and (if you did it) "[QT897 The Harvester]" ([G45,59]).
19) Go just south of CT (around [G45,64]) and do "[QC913 Cry of the Thunderhawk]": kill/loot a Thunderhawk. 6 spawns around CT (see map). Drop rate is 100%.
20) Go back to CT and turn in "[QT913 Cry of the Thunderhawk]" ([G45,59], #5 on map), SKIP "Mahren Skyseer".
21) Go to the Wind Rider Master at CT ([G44,59]) and fly to Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.
