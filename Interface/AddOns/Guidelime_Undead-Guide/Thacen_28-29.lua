01) In the Inn, turn in "[QT1196 The Sacred Flame]" ([G46,52] in Thousand Needles), accept the next [QA1197 part]. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
02) Take the Lift down from Freewind Post and then go to the cave north (entrance is at [G44,37]) and do "[QC1197 The Sacred Flame]": keep hugging the left side of the cave until you get to the Ancient Brazier, then loot it (See Video).
03) REMINDER: Keep an eye out for the Galak Messenger /target and kill/loot this centaur when you see him in 1k Needles. He has a very large patrol path. He drops an item which starts "[QA4881 Assassination Plot]", accept it (if you can). But, don't intentionally do this yet, continue on with the next step...
04) Grind west to Whitereach Post ([G21,32]) and turn in "[QT4865 Serpent Wild]", accept "[QA5062 Sacred Fire]". And next to you, accept "[QA5151 Hypercapacitor Gizmo]". NOTES: If you have already killed Galak Messenger /target and accepted the quest from the item he dropped, then turn in "[QT4881 Assassination Plot]", then accept, do & turn in the easy follow up escort quest. You can also get resupplied here from Laer Stepperunner.
05) Go east to the Boiling Pool ([G35,35]) and do "[QC5062 Sacred Fire]": loot the Incendia Agave from the ground and under the water.
06) Go west and do "[QC1131 Steelsnap]": kill/loot Steelsnap /target. This hyena patrols counter-clockwise around a somewhat large circle (starting at [G18,26]) and has two bodyguards. Original spawn is in Camp E-thok ([G17,19]). (See Video)
07) If you are still working on "[QC1153 A New Ore Sample]", then see if you can find the Ore Sample: kill/loot the Gravelsnout Surveyors /target (there are two spawns nearby to check) for the Unrefined Ore Sample (see map for locations).
08) Go to the Highperch (entrance is [G13,34]) and do "[QC4767 Wind Rider]": loot the Highperch Wyvern Eggs from the ground.
09) In Highperch, go up the mountain ramp ([G14,40]). Once up there watch out for Heartrazor /target (a patrolling rare elite with a 12 hour respawn) and then accept and do the escort quest there "[QC4770 Homeward Bound]". You can have the escort try to help you kill the rare elite. It's also possible to time it so you can start and complete the escort so the rare is out of the way (just as he passes from the escortee). If you fail, then this escort can be skipped.
10) Once again, if you are still working on "[QC1153 A New Ore Sample]": kill/loot the Gravelsnout Surveyors /target (there are two spawns nearby to check) for the Unrefined Ore Sample (see map for locations, #7 on map).
11) Hearth to Thunder Bluff.
12) Go to The Hunter Rise and turn in "[QT1131 Steelsnap]" ([G61,81]). Accept "[QA1136 Frostmaw]".
13) If you haven't got all your level 28 spells/abilities you need yet, do so now. 
14) Go to The Elder Rise and turn in "[QT5062 Sacred Fire]" ([G70,31]). Accept "[QA5088 Arikara]".
15) Go to the Wind Rider Master at the top of the tower in the middle of TB ([G47,50]) and fly to Freewind Post, Thousand Needles.
16) Right when you land back at Freewind Post, turn in "[QT4767 Wind Rider]" ([G45,49] in Thousand Needles). 
17) Go in the Inn ([G46,52]) and make Freewind Post your new home.
18) Next to you in the Inn, turn in "[QT1197 The Sacred Flame]". Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
19) Go up the mountain ramp (starting at [G31,37]) that allows you to enter Darkcloud Pinnacle at the top...
20) Once you get to the top do "[QC5064 Grimtotem Spying]": loot the three Document Chests for the secret notes. For Secret Note #1, cross the bridges up in Darkcloud Pinnacle until you get to the Document Chest ([G32,33]) and loot it. For the other two, see next steps...
21) Secret Note #2 is in the hut ([G34,40]).
22) Secret Note #3 is in the hut ([G39,41]).
23) Go over to the other pinnacle (up at [G38,35]) and do "[QC5088 Arikara]" (Elite): click on the Sacred Fire of Life in the middle of the pinnacle, then kill/loot Arikara (lvl 28 elite). (See Video)
24) Stay up and go north (to [G38,27]) then do "[QC5147 Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem]": kill/loot Arnak Grimtotem /target.
25) Do the escort "[QC4904 Free at Last]" (same area, [G38,26], #6 on map): escort Lakota Windsong /target all the way out of Darkcloud Pinnacle.
26) Go to Whitereach Post ([G21,32]) and turn in "[QT4770 Homeward Bound]" and "[QT5088 Arikara]". You can also get resupplied here from Laer Stepperunner.
27) You should be level 29 by now, if not grind to level 29, I grind away at centaurs around Camp E'Thok ([G18,23]) or wyverns at Highperch (entrance is [G14,34]).
28) Do "[QC5151 Hypercapacitor Gizmo]" (Elite): clear the mobs around the Panther Cage ([G23,24]), open the cage and kill the lvl 30 elite panther. 
29) This is your last chance to kill/loot the centaur Galak Messenger /target. He has a very large patrol path (see map). He drops an item which starts "[QA4881 Assassination Plot]", accept it. If you can't find him in time, then skip it along with the follow up quest.
30) Go to Whitereach Post ([G21,33], #8 on map) and turn in "[QT5151 Hypercapacitor Gizmo]". Also turn in (if you did it) "[QA4881 Assassination Plot]", accept and do the easy and short escort "[QC4966 Protect Kanati Greycloud]", then turn it in.
31) Hearth to Freewind Post.
32) In the Inn, turn in "[QT4904 Free at Last]" ([G46,52]).
33) Just outside the Inn, turn in "[QT5064 Grimtotem Spying]" and "[QT5147 Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem]" ([G56,51]).
34) Go to the Wind Rider Master (north in Freewind Post, [G45,49]) and if you have "[QT1153 A New Ore Sample]" finished fly to Camp Taurajo, The Barrens to turn it in. Then, (or otherwise) fly to Orgrimmar, Durotar.
35) Once at Orgrimmar, (if for some reason you are already level 30) go get new spells/abilities. 
36) Go in the Inn and make Orgrimmar your new home from the Innkeeper ([G54,68]).
37) Go to the Bank ([G50,70]) and put the following item into it: Kodo Skin Scroll. And get out (if you have it) Swim Speed Potions, you can get these from the AH as well.
38) The goal now is to go all the way to Hillsbrad Foothills. To get there, first leave Orgrimmar at the south entrance, then get on a Zeppelin ([G51,14] in Durotar) to go to the Undercity. Make sure you get on the Undercity Zeppelin (south landing) and not the STV zeppelin (north landing)!
