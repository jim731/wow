[N29-30 Hillsbrad Foothills]
[GA Horde]
[D A guide created by T H A C E N#9446\Based on Joana's Speed Leveling guide https://www.joanasworld.com]
01) Run all the way to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad Foothills and get the FP there from the Bat Handler ([G60,19] in Hillsbrad). You can just bypass the UC for now (no need to get UC's FP yet) and just follow the path shown on the map to get to Hillsbrad. NOTES: If you can, use a Swim Speed Potion to cross the lake. Once you reach Alterac Mountains you can start grinding on some mobs along the way to Tarren Mill. TIP: Focus on killing some Snapjaw turtles along the shore and save the Turtle Meat for a later quest, I recommend obtaining at least 4 Turtle Meat before moving on (you can get more later on), and remember to not sell them to a vendor!
02) In the small house ([G61,19]), accept "[QA496 Elixir of Suffering]", "[QA501 Elixir of Pain]" and "[QA509 Elixir of Agony]".
03) From High Executor Darthalia in front of the church, accept "[QA527 Battle of Hillsbrad]" ([G62,21]).
04) At the graveyard next to the church building, accept "[QA552 Helcular's Revenge]" ([G64,20]).
05) At the Dangerous! sign (next to the mailbox/Inn), accept "[QA567 Dangerous!]" ([G63,20]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
06) Go east to the vertical river running through Hillsbrad ([G68,21]), and start working on "[QC496 Elixir of Suffering]" along with obtaining 10 Turtle Meat from the Snapjaw turtles in the river for a later quest (and remember not to sell them). Higher level spiders and bears are found east of the river. Work your way toward the next step:
07) South at Nethander Stead (around [G64,62]) do "[QC509 Elixir of Agony]": loot the Mudsnout Blossoms around the farm.
08) Start working on "[QC501 Elixir of Pain]" (kill/loot cats south and west of the farm) and finish "[QC496 Elixir of Suffering]" (kill/loot bears and spiders, #1 on map). The Spiders are everywhere, while the bears are more north of the farm along with lower level bears around Tarren Mill.
09) Go back to Tarren Mill, and in the small house, turn in "[QT496 Elixir of Suffering]", accept the next [QA499 part]. Then turn it in right next to you in the house. And turn in "[QT509 Elixir of Agony]", SKIP the next part.
10) Go in the Inn (bigger house [G62,19]). From Christoph Jeffcoat, accept "[QA7321 Soothing Turtle Bisque]" (requires the cooking profession to accept). From this NPC, buy a Soothing Spices. Then with your Turtle Meat you farmed earlier, simply turn in the quest right there.
11) Go SW to the yeti cave ([G46,32]) and do "[QC552 Helcular's Revenge]": keep killing the yetis until Helcular's Rod drops (it's a very low drop rate). Also, just outside of the cave finish "[QC501 Elixir of Pain]": kill/loot the Starving Mountain Lions (#3 on map).
12) Go back to the small house at Tarren Mill and turn in "[QT501 Elixir of Pain]" ([G61,19]), accept the next [QA502 part].
13) At the graveyard next to the church, turn in "[QT552 Helcular's Revenge]" ([G64,20]), accept the next [QA553 part]. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
14) Go SW back to the yeti cave ([G46,32]) and start doing the next part of "[QC553 Helcular's Revenge]": charge 2 of 3 Flames (for now). Go right as you enter the cave for the first one. Then drop down in the cave and go north for the 2nd one. The 3rd one will be done later in the guide.
15) Go west to the front of the house at the farm and turn in "[QT502 Elixir of Pain]" ([G33,35]).
16) In the immediate area, start working on "[QC527 Battle of Hillsbrad]" along with "[QC567 Dangerous!]": kill the Hillsbrad Farmers & Farmhands (the ones holding shovels or rakes) and 6 named mobs. First named mob to kill is Farmer Ray /target up in the house ([G33,35], #2 on map) where Stanley the wolf was at.
17) Kill Citizen Wilkes /target (patrols on the path around [G33,38]). Wikes patrols between the house you are at now to the other small house to the east of the path.
18) Kill Farmer Getz /target either in the small house, barn or field (around [G37,39]).
19) Kill Farmer Kalaba /target (she patrols around the farm [G35,47]).
20) Kill Clerk Horrace Whitesteed /target in the Town Hall building (entrance is at [G31,42]). He is wearing brown clothes. Be cautious he is heavily guarded. NOTE: Make sure "[QC527 Battle of Hillsbrad]" is finished before proceeding to next step.
21) Kill Miner Hackett /target in the mine. Check out the lower entrance first at [G27,59]. Make sure you go to the lower mine entrance, then keep hugging the right side of the mine until you get to Miner Hackett. NOTE: If he is not there, then he will be at another spot in the mine, look around for him.
22) Make sure you are at least 2 bars away from level 30 (grind mobs in the mine), then die on purpose to get back to Tarren Mill (res at spirit).
23) From High Executor Darthalia in front of the church, turn in "[QT527 Battle of Hillsbrad]" (SKIP the next part) and "[QT567 Dangerous!]" ([G62,21]).
24) In the church building, accept "[QA1361 Regthar Deathgate]" ([G63,21]). Requires lvl 30. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
25) Go east into Arathi Highlands...
