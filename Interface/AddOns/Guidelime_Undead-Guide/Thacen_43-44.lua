01) At the small cave in Brackenwall Village, accept "[QA1169 Identifying the Brood]" ([G37,33]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
02) Go SE to the ogre ([G41,37], /target) on the path and accept and do the escort "[QC1273 Questioning Reethe]" (no exclamation mark): follow Ogron, then kill the mobs that spawn in next to Paval Reethe.
03) Go south and do "[QC1205 Deadmire]": kill/loot Deadmire /target. This white colored lvl 45 crocolisk patrols up and down the river (around [G47,55]) and is with some elites around the river as well, so be careful!
04) Go east to the crashed zeppelin and do "[QC1187 Razzeric's Tweaking]": loot the Gizmorium Shipping Crate (box at [G54,56]).
05) Go east to the shore/water (around [G57,63]) and do "[QC1261 Marg Speaks]": kill/loot the Muckshell mobs until the Jeweled Pendant drops (very low drop rate).
06) Go SW and do "[QC1169 Identifying the Brood]": kill/loot dragon whelps. The Searing Hatchlings (are non elite), and the Searing Whelps (are elite, but still easy to solo). Watch out for the elite crocolisks and especially the Firemane dragons in the area!
07) Grind your way back to Brackenwall Village and before getting there make sure you are at least 3 bars away from lvl 44, then at the west side of Brackenwall Village, turn in "[QT1261 Marg Speaks]" ([G35,31]), accept "[QA1262 Report to Zor]".
08) From Krog, turn in "[QT1273 Questioning Reethe]" ([G36,32]). Accept "[QA1276 The Black Shield]" (no exclamation mark).
09) In the small cave, turn in "[QT1169 Identifying the Brood]" ([G37,33], #1 on map). Wait a few seconds then accept "[QA1170 The Brood of Onyxia]".
10) Next to the Bonfire, turn in "[QT1170 The Brood of Onyxia]" ([G36,31]), accept the next [QA1171 part].
11) Go back in the cave and turn in "[QT1171 The Brood of Onyxia]" ([G37,33], #1 on map), SKIP the next part (for now).

13) Go to the Wind Rider Master ([G36,32]) and fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore.
14) Stop at the Bank ([G47,59]) and get the following item out: Draenethyst Shard. Also if you have 60 Wool Cloth, then 60 Silk Cloth and then 60 Mageweave Cloth, get those out as well (for cloth donations). Put the following items in the bank: Jeweled Pendant and Seaforium Booster.
15) Go just south to the Inn and make Thunder Bluff your new home from the Innkeeper ([G46,65]).
16) Go to the NW hut on The Hunter Rise and turn in "[QT1276 The Black Shield]" ([G54,81]).
17) Also on the Hunter Rise, turn in "[QT1205 Deadmire]" ([G62,81]). You should have dinged 44 by now.

19) If you have the 60 Wool Cloth, then 60 Silk Cloth and then 60 Mageweave Cloth go turn them in up in the hut from Rumstag Proudstrider (Tauren faction cloth donations).
