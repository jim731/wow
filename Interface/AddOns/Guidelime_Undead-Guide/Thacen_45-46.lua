32) Go to the Bank ([G50,69]) and put in the bank: Yeh'kinya's Bramble. And get the following items out of the bank: Jeweled Pendant. Also (depending on what cloth donations you already turned in at Orgrimmar) get your Silk Cloth and Mageweave Cloth out of your bank or mailbox ([G50,69]). You would need 60 or 120 Silk Cloth and 60 or 120 Mageweave Cloth. This is for Cloth Donation quests you are about to turn in.
33) Go to The Drag and up in the hut, turn in "[QT7732 Zukk'ash Report]" ([G56,47]).
34) Drop down to Magar's Cloth Goods and turn in the cloth donations to the Orc's Horde Cloth Quartermaster ([G64,51]). Also, if you only have 60 Silk Cloth, save that for the other Silk Cloth turn in later instead!
35) Go in Droffers And Sons Salvage and accept "[QA649 Ripple Recovery]" ([G59,37]). Next to you, turn that in and accept the next [QA650 part].
36) Go east to the Valley of Honor at Belgrom Rockmaul ([G75,34]) and turn in "[QT1184 Parts of the Swarm]" and "[QT2976 A Grim Discovery]". Accept "[QA3504 Betrayed]".

40) Next to you, turn in as much cloth as you can to the Horde Cloth Quartermaster (for the troll faction).
41) At this point in the game, I tend to have just enough gold to finally get my mount. So if you have 90 gold, go get your mount. NOTES: If you cannot afford this now, my guide will not remind you again. So get your mount when you can. See my Mount Guide for more info on where to find your mount trainer/vendor.
42) Hearth back to Camp Mojache, Feralas.
43) Next to the big tent from Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43]), turn in "[QT3122 Retrun to Witch Doctor Uzer'i]". Wait a few seconds then accept "[QA3123 Testing the Vessel]" and "[QA3128 Natural Materials]".
44) Go just west of Camp Mojache (around [G68,48]) and do part of "[QC3128 Natural Materials]": kill/loot the Sprite Darters for the Encrusted Minerals.
45) Go SW of The High Wilderness and finish up "[QC3128 Natural Materials]": kill/loot the Frayfeather mobs (hippogryphs) for the Resilient Sinew and Metallic Fragments. Also kill/loot Wandering Forest Walkers /target for the Splintered Logs (there is one wandering around south of the hippogryphs, spawn at [G57,73]). Keep next step in mind:
46) South of the Hippogryphs along the cliffs (around [G57,78]), loot a Hippogryph Egg in one of the nests. This will be turned in at Tanaris for a later quest. And remember to not sell this! Also, start collecting Long Elegant Feathers, these drop by the Frayfeather Hippogryphs in the northern part of the hippogryph area. These are used for a later quest, and do not sell them to a vendor. You will be able to farm more of these later, but try to focus on killing these hippos more.
47) If you are not level 46 yet, grind until you are on hippogryphs or yetis (#3 and #6 on map).
48) While questing in Feralas, you may come across an item called OOX-22/FE Distress Beacon, from it accept "[QA2766 Find OOX-22/FE!]". Then turn this in through the small cave (at [G51,57]) and do the escort "[QC2767 Rescue OOX-22/FE!]". TIP: Before doing the escort, clear the path of yetis/bears to the main path, otherwise this escort can be really tough. Try to keep aggro off of the Robot Chicken /target, as it can die easily. This is also a fairly long escort ([G12,5] minutes). If you fail, you can try again later on in the guide at lvl 49.
49) Hearth to Camp Mojache.
50) Make sure you are repaired/resupplied. REMINDER: Do not sell your Long Elegant Feathers and Hippogryph Egg.
51) Next to the big tent from Witch Doctor Uzer'i ([G74,43], #1 on map), turn in "[QT3128 Natural Materials]".
52) Go to the Wind Rider Master ([G75,44]) and if you need to, first fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore to get new spells/abilities, then or otherwise fly to Splintertree Post, Ashenvale. NOTE: You can also turn in cloth donation quests in TB (at [G43,43]) for the Tauren faction if you need to.
53) Follow the main path east into Azshara..
