10) While working on the following steps, also start working on [QC844 Plainstrider Menace] and [QC869 Raptor Thieves] by killing plainstriders and raptors all around the fields of the Barrens, but don't make it your main priority:
11) Go NE and do [QC871 Disrupt the Attacks]: kill the needed Razormane mobs (all around [G54,27]). ALSO: Back in the Razormane camp there is a barrel called Chen's Empty Keg [G56,27], loot it and accept the quest from the item received.

Tick: As you continue on in The Barrens, you might be a few levels above what the guide indicates, but that is ok, simply follow The Barrens guide entirely (whether you did the Silverpine section or not).
