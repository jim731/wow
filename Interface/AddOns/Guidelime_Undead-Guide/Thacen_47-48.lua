[D A guide created by T H A C E N#9446\Based on Joana's Speed Leveling guide https://www.joanasworld.com]
01) Go SE in Searing Gorge and from the Wooden Outhouse ([G66,63Searing Gorge]), accept "[QA4449 Caught!]".
02) At the Grimesilt Dig Site next to you (around [G63,61]), do "[QC4449 Caught!]": kill 8 Dark Iron Geologists. Also make sure you have 15 Silk Cloth (it can drop from the dwarves at the Dig Site). The Geologists are limited, so you will most likely need to grind on mobs until they respawn (or go north for a few more).
03) Go back to the Wooden Outhouse ([G66,63], #1 on map), and turn in "[QT4449 Caught!]", accept "[QA4450 Ledger from Tanaris]". Then pick up the Goodsteel Ledger (it drops on the ground next to the outhouse).
04) Do part of "[QC4450 Ledger from Tanaris]": kill/loot Glassweb Spiders for the Leg Shafts. These are scattered on the eastern side of Searing Gorge.
05) Go up NW and from Kalaran Windblade (at [G39,39]) accept "[QA3441 Divine Retribution]", then do it by simply talking to him. Then turn it in. From him, accept "[QA3442 The Flawless Flame]".
06) Go up to Thorium Point (entrance at [G32,33])...
07) Accept ALL quests at Thorium Point ([G38,28]): From the WANTED/Missing/Lost & Found sign accept "[QA7701 WANTED: Overseer Maltorius]" (Elite), "[QA7728 STOLEN: Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass]" and "[QA7729 JOB OPPORTUNITY: Culling the Competition]". And next to you accept "[QA7723 Curse These Fat Fingers]", "[QA7724 Fiery Menace!]", "[QA7727 Incendosaurs? Whateverosaur is More Like It]" and "[QA7722 What the Flux?]".
08) Make sure you are repaired/resupplied from Master Smith Burninate ([G39,28]) next to the Forge.
09) Get the FP from the Wind Rider Master ([G35,31]) at Thorium Point.
NOTE: Do the Searing Gorge grind! Do this section all at once (in any order):
10) "[QC3442 The Flawless Flame]": kill/loot Magma Elementals, Tempered War Golems, and Heavy War Golems for the Golem Oil. See next step for the Heart of Flame:
11) Kill/loot the fire elementals for the Heart of Flame, these include: Inferno Elementals, Blazing Elementals and Magma Elementals.
12) "[QC7724 Fiery Menace!]": kill Greater Lava Spiders around the western side of Searing Gorge.
13) "[QC7723 Curse These Fat Fingers]": kill Heavy War Golems around the middle of Searing Gorge.
14) "[QC7728 STOLEN: Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass]": kill/loot Dark Iron Steamsmith for the Smithing Tuyere (around [G40,50]). See next step for where to find the Lookout's Spyglass:
15) Kill/loot Dark Iron Lookouts for the Lookout's Spyglass, these mobs are scattered around the watchtowers at Searing Gorge, there is a large amount (around [G53,58]), see map for other locations.
16) Once "[QT3442 The Flawless Flame]" is done, turn it in at Kalaran Windblade ([G39,39]) and accept "[QA3443 Forging the Shaft]".
17) "[QC7729 JOB OPPORTUNITY: Culling the Competition]": enter one of the caves down in The Cauldron (middle of Searing Gorge), I recommend going into the eastern most cave (at [G50,45]) and then kill the needed Dark Iron dwarves in the cave.
18) "[QC7722 What the Flux?]" and (if you can) "[QC7701 WANTED: Overseer Maltorius]" (Elite): if you can, loot the Secret Plans: Fiery Flux behind Overseer Maltorius ([G41,36] in the cave). Class's with pets can use them to distract the elite, then run away. Other classes may have abilities to get the item as well. If you can, kill/loot Overseer Maltorius (lvl 50 Elite), but be warned he is very tough. Even a level 60 will have a hard time soloing this mob, so you will most likely need a group to kill him. If not, then it can be skipped.
19) "[QC3443 Forging the Shaft]": kill/loot Dark Iron dwarves for the Thorium Plated Daggers. NOTES: This quest requires "[QT3442 The Flawless Flame]" to be finished and turned in first. Save any Dark Iron Scraps you find, you will need 30 of them for a later quest, but you will also have another good chance to find a lot more later on in the lvl 53-54 Burning Steppes section as well.
20) "[QC7727 Incendosaurs? Whateverosaur is More Like It]": enter the cave (at [G47,46]) and kill Incendosaurs.
21) While doing these quests (specifically from killing the Dark Iron dwarves), you should have obtained an item called Grimsite Outhouse Key, from it accept "[QA4451 The Key to Freedom]". We will turn this in later!
22) Go to Kalaran Windblade ([G39,39]) and turn in "[QT3443 Forging the Shaft]", accept "[QA3452 The Flame's Casing]".
23) Go up to Thorium Point (entrance at [G32,33])...
24) Turn in all quests ([G39,28]): (if you did it) "[QT7701 WANTED: Overseer Maltorius]", "[QT7723 Curse These Fat Fingers]", "[QT7724 Fiery Menace!]", "[QT7727 Incendosaurs? Whateverosaur is More Like It]", "[QT7728 STOLEN: Smithing Tuyere and Lookout's Spyglass]", "[QT7729 JOB OPPORTUNITY: Culling the Competition]" and "[QT7722 What the Flux?]". Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
25) Go west (around [G24,37]) and do "[QC3452 The Flame's Casing]" (Elite): kill/loot the elite Twilight mobs until the Symbol of Ragnaros drops (low drop rate). Group up with someone if you can and if you have too much trouble then this can be skipped, but most classes should be able to solo this.
26) Go east to Kalaran Windblade ([G39,39], #1 on map) and turn in "[QT3452 The Flame's Casing]", accept "[QA3453 The Torch of Retribution]".
27) Wait a few seconds, then turn in "[QT3453 The Torch of Retribution]", accept the next [QA3454 part]. Then click on the Torch of Retribution in the air next to you to turn in the next part of "[QT3453 The Torch of Retribution]". Accept "[QA3462 Squire Maltrake]". Next to you, turn in "[QT3462 Squire Maltrake]", accept "[QA3463 Set Them Ablaze!]".
28) Do "[QC3463 Set Them Ablaze!]": equip the Torch of Retribution quest item and at the top of the 4 watchtowers, click on the Sentry Braziers and watch out for the elites. The Northern Tower is at ([G33,55]). See next steps for the others:
29) The Western Tower is at ([G36,61]).
30) The Southern Tower is at ([G44,61]).
31) The Eastern Tower is at ([G50,55]). NOTE: You must cross a bridge to get to it and there are 2 elites patrolling on it.
32) While doing the quests associated with killing the Dark Iron dwarves, you should have obtained an item called Grimsite Outhouse Key, from it accept "[QA4451 The Key to Freedom]". Then go SE and turn this in at the Wooden Outhouse ([G66,63]).
33) Just next to you at the dig site, die on purpose then res at spirit to get to Thorium Point.
34) Go south a bit to Kalaran Windblade ([G39,39]) and turn in "[QT3463 Set Them Ablaze!]".
35) Wait a minute (build up First Aid while waiting), then click on the Hoard of the Black Dragonflight ([G39,39]) chest on the ground next to Kalaran Windblade and accept "[QA3481 Trinkets...]". Then click on the chest again to turn this in. Loot the chest received.
36) NOTES: Make sure you keep the Black Dragonflight Molt in your inventory as you will need it for a later quest. Also make sure you have all 20 Solid Crystal Leg Shafts for the quest "Ledger from Tanaris".
37) Head south into Burning Steppes (entrance at [G35,85] in Searing Gorge). NOTE: You have to go through Black Rock Mountains.
38) Once at Burning Steppes, first head to ([G24,52]) just to discover Draco'dar for XP.
39) Just north of the main path, die on purpose to the elite dragons (around [G21,46]), then res at spirt.
40) Go up the ramp into Flame Crest. You can get repaired/resupplied in the small cave from the female goblin.
41) At the Wind Rider Master ([G66,24]) fly to Stonard, Swamp of Sorrows. NOTE: If you still have "What the Flux?" and "WANTED: Overseer Maltorius" they can be abandoned.
