01) Down the path at the intersection, accept "[QA407 Fields of Grief]" ([G41,54]).
02) Run east to Brill ([G58,51]), grinding mobs along the way, and make sure you get to level 6 before you get there (for new spells/abilities).  Along the way on the path accept "[QA5481 Gordo's Task]" (from Gordo).
03) Once at Brill, in front of the graveyard entrance, accept "[QA404 A Putrid Task]" ([G58,51], #2 on map).
04) Go in the first house on your right and accept "[QA367 A New Plague]" ([G59,52]).  And just outside of the house pick up Apprentice Herbalist from the Herbalism Trainer. I recommend getting this for helping you find the Gloom Weed and Doom Weeds later in this zone.
05) In front of the Town Hall building, turn in "[QT383 Vital Intelligence]" ([G61,52]).  Accept "[QA427 At War with the Scarlet Crusade]".
06) Right behind this NPC, accept "[QA398 Wanted: Maggot Eye]" (from the Wanted! sign).
07) Go in the Town Hall building right next to you and accept "[QA358 Graverobbers]".
08) Go in the Inn and the first NPC you see ([G62,53]) get Apprentice First Aid.  At the Innkeeper turn in "[QT8 A Rogue's Deal]".  Also make this Inn your new home for your Hearthstone (by talking to the Innkeeper).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
09) In Brill's Inn, get your level 6 spells/abilities.  The Priest Trainer is upstairs.  Also from your trainer, turn in "[QT5651 In Favor of Darkness]", accept "[QA5650 Garments of Darkness]".
10) Go just west of Brill and do "[QC5481 Gordo's Task]" and "[QC404 A Putrid Task]": pick up Gloom Weed and kill/loot zombies.  Also, start working on (but does not need to be completed yet) "[QC367 A New Plague]" (kill/loot darkhounds).  TIPS:  There is a merchant in the small house ([G53,56]) that you can sell items to.  Don't forget to turn Find Herbs on to spot the Gloom Weed on mini map.
11) Once "[QC5481 Gordo's Task]" and "[QC404 A Putrid Task]" are finished, go in front of the graveyard entrance and turn in "[QT404 A Putrid Task]" ([G58,51], #2 on map).  Accept "[QA426 The Mills Overrun]".
12) Go to the grave next to you ([G57,49]) and turn in "[QT5481 Gordo's Task]" (the NPC patrols around the grave), accept "[QA5482 Doom Weed]".
Priest, 12a) At the north graveyard gate entrance ([G59,46]) do "[QC5650 Garments of Darkness]": use Lesser Heal (R2) and Power Word: Fortitude on Deathguard Kel /target kneeling down.
13) Go just north above Brill and do "[QC358 Graverobbers]" along with "[QC5482 Doom Weed]": kill/loot the Rot Hide Graverobbers (around [G55,42]), and pickup Doom Weeds all around the area.  You will find the Rot Hide Mongrels north at the farm (around [G61,37]).  Keep the next step in mind:
14) First make sure you are level 7, then do "[QC398 Wanted: Maggot Eye]": kill/loot Maggot Eye in the hut ([G59,31]).  TIPS:  This can be hard to solo, make sure you are prepared and try to team up with some one if you can.  If you cant do it then skip it or try later.
15) On the east side of the path, finish "[QC367 A New Plague]": kill/loot Darkhounds (demon dogs).
16) Grind back to Brill and in the Inn, accept "[QA354 Deaths in the Family]" and "[QA362 The Haunted Mills]" ([G62,52]).  And go upstairs in the Inn and accept "[QA375 The Chill of Death]".  Also, upstairs at the Priest Trainer, turn in "[QT5650 Garments of Darkness]".
17) In front of the Town Hall, turn in (if you did it) "[QT398 Wanted: Maggot Eye]" ([G61,52]).
18) Go in the Town Hall and turn in "[QT358 Graverobbers]".  Accept "[QA359 Forsaken Duties]" ([G61,51]).
19) In the small house ([G59,52]), turn in "[QT367 A New Plague]", accept the next [QA368 part].  Make sure you are all repaired and resupplied.
20) Go to the grave and turn in "[QT5482 Doom Weed]" (NPC patrols around [G57,49]). 
NOTE:  While doing this section start working on "[QC375 The Chill of Death]" by kill/looting Duskbats you see along the way:
21) Go NW to Agamand Mills and do "[QC426 The Mills Overrun]" (kill/loot the skeletons around the mill) while also killing the named mobs for "[QC354 Deaths in the Family]" and "[QC362 The Haunted Mills]". Follow the steps below to kill the named mobs for these quests:
22) Kill/loot Devlin Agamand /target, a skeleton warrior patroling around the grassy area ([G47,41]).
23) Kill/loot Nissa Agamand /target, she is a ghost that patrols around in the house ([G50,36]).
24) Kill/loot Gregor Agamand /target, a ghoul that patrols around the windmill ([G46,30]).  His original spawn point is ([G47,29]).
25) Kill/loot Thurman Agamand /target, a zombie that patrols between the two windmills next to the cliff (around [G44,34]).
26) Make sure "[QC426 The Mills Overrun]" is finished then go SW and do "[QC407 Fields of Grief]" and "[QC427 At War with the Scarlet Crusade]": pickup Tirisfal Pumpkins and kill/loot the Scarlet Warriors.  You will find more Scarlet Warriors north and west of the farm.
27) Go north to the beach (around [G35,45]) and do "[QC368 A New Plague]": kill/loot the murlocs.
28) Hearth to Brill and next to you in the Inn turn in "[QT354 Deaths in the Family]" and "[QT362 The Haunted Mills]", accept "[QA355 Speak with Sevren]".  NOTE: While doing the Agamand quests, you may have received an item called A Letter to Yvette, accept "[QA361 A Letter Undelivered]" from it, then turn it in the Inn.
29) Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.  Also get your level 8 spells/abilities.  The Priest Trainer is upstairs in the Inn.
30) Leave the Inn and in front of the Town Hall, turn in "[QT427 At War with the Scarlet Crusade]" ([G61,52]), accept the next [QA370 part].  Also next to you accept "[QA374 Proof of Demise]".
31) In the Town Hall turn in "[QT355 Speak with Sevren]" ([G61,51]), accept "[QA408 The Family Crypt]".
32) In the small house ([G59,52]), turn in "[QT407 Fields of Grief]" and "[QT368 A New Plague]", accept the next part to both of these quests.
33) At the graveyard entrance, turn in "[QT426 The Mills Overrun]" ([G58,52]).
34) If you finished "[QC375 The Chill of Death]", go to the Trade Supplies vendor (under the red tent [G61,52]) and purchase a Coarse Thread, then go upstairs in the Inn and turn in "[QT375 The Chill of Death]" (but it doesn't need to be completed now). 
35) Go downstairs in the Inn and turn in "[QT407 Fields of Grief]" ([G62,51]).
36) At this point if you are not level 10, then go just south of Brill and grind until you are.  Focus mostly on Greater Duskbat for "[QC375 The Chill of Death]", and you can work your way to ([G52,65]) and kill/loot Scarlet mobs until you are level 10.
