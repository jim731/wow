01) As you enter Swamp of Sorrows (SoS) start working on "[QC1116 Dream Dust in the Swamp]": kill/loot the dragon whelps around the lake (SW at [G15,56] in SoS) for the dream dust. Just clear the whelps in this area once. When you run out of whelps to kill, move on to the next steps (You can revisit this area later):
02) Go up north to Misty Valley and do the first part of "[QC1383 Nothing But the Truth]": kill/loot the Mire Lord in the cave ([G6,31]) for the Mire Lord Fungus.
03) If you need to, go back SW to the lake and continue working on "[QC1116 Dream Dust in the Swamp]": kill/loot dragon whelps ([G15,56], #1 on map). NOTE: You will be able to kill dragons around the Temple of Atal'Hakkar lake (Pools of Tears) later on for more dust.
04) Go east and then find and kill/loot Noboru the Cudgel /target. See patrol path on map (spawns at [G47,39]). He drops an item which starts "[QA1392 Noboru the Cudgel]", accept it.
05) Go NW to The Harborage and turn in "[QT1392 Noboru the Cudgel]" ([G26,31]). Accept "[QA1389 Draenethyst Crystals]" (no exclamation mark).

08) Go upstairs in the building and turn in "[QT1420 Report to Helgrum]" ([G48,55]). Next to you, accept "[QA1420 Pool of Tears]" (Elite).
09) Do "[QC1424 Pool of Tears]" (Elite): loot the Atal'ai Artifacts under the lake around the Temple of Atal Hakkar (around [G65,54]). Use water breathing potions (if you're not undead) and any Swim Speed Potions if you have any. ALSO: Continue working on (if you still need to) "[QC1116 Dream Dust in the Swamp]" by kill/looting any dragons you see around the lake.
10) Do "[QC698 Lack of Surplus]": kill/loot crocolisks. There are Sawtooth Crocolisks (around the middle of SoS) and Sawtooth Snappers (around the NE of SoS). Also, start working on part of "[QC1383 Nothing But the Truth]" by kill/looting the Shadow Panthers /target (around the cliffs above the shore line) for the Hearts, and you will have more opportunities later to kill the panthers.
11) Go SE to Misty Reed Post and turn in "[QT698 Lack of Surplus]" ([G81,80]), accept the next [QA699 part].
12) Work your way north and continue working on part of "[QC1383 Nothing But the Truth]": kill/loot Shadow Panthers /target (around the cliffs above the shore line) for the Hearts. There are only a few mob spawns, so work on the next steps as well:
13) Around NE of SoS do "[QC699 Lack of Surplus]": kill/loot Sawtooth Snappers.
14) Go north to the Fallow Sanctuary and from the human /target in the cage ([G65,18]), accept and try to do the escort "[QC1393 Galen's Escape]" (it's wise to clear the mobs around the cage first). Also do "[QC1389 Draenethyst Crystals]" along with "[QC1373 Ongeku]": loot the Draenethyst Crystals around the village and also kill/loot Ongeku (at [G65,22]).
15) Above Stonard, at Galen's Strongbox (next to a tent, [G48,40]), turn in (if you were able to do it) "[QT1393 Galen's Escape]".
