[D A guide created by T H A C E N#9446\Based on Joana's Speed Leveling guide https://www.joanasworld.com]
01) After you have Hearthed to Orgrimmar, go to the Bank ([G49,69Winterspring]) and put the following items into it: any remaining Core of Elements, Bone Fragments, Savage Fronds, Dark Iron Scraps and any Insignias.
02) Go up to the Wind Rider Master ([G45,64]) and fly to Bloodvenom Post, Felwood.
03) At Bloodvenom Post, accept "[QA4741 Wild Guardians]". Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
04) Go NE to Irontree Woods (around [G50,23] in Felwood) and do "[QC5086 Toxic Horrors]": kill/loot Toxic Horrors (green water elementals).
05) Go through Timbermaw Hold (entrance at [G65,8] in Felwood) and make a right in the middle after the bridge to enter Moonglade up north.
06) Once in Moonglade, go to Nighthaven and at Umber, turn in "[QT6844 Umber, Archivist]" ([G45,36]), accept "[QA6845 Uncovering Past Secrets]".
07) Go into Nighthaven and turn in "[QT5527 A Reliquary of Purity]" ([G52,45]), SKIP "Shards of the Felvine" (Dungeon). Also turn in "[QT6845 Uncovering Past Secrets]".
08) Go back to Umber at Nighthaven and complete "[QT1185 Under the Chitin Was...]" ([G45,36], #6 on map).
09) Exit Moonglade at the SW path to go back to Timbermaw Hold ([G45,36] in Moonglade).
10) In Timbermaw Hold, make a right after the stairs (NOT the bridge) to go into Winterspring..
11) Go south to Donova Snowden ([G31,45] in Winterspring) and turn in "[QT5086 Toxic Horrors]", accept "[QA5087 Winterfall Runners]".
12) Try to do "[QC5087 Winterfall Runners]": try to find the pack of Winterfall Runners (three lvl 57s) that patrols the main path from the Timbermaw Hold cave ([G28,35]) to Winterfall Village ([G68,38]) and kill/loot them for the Winterfall Crate. See map for exact patrol path. If after making one pass and you cannot find these mobs, then this can be skipped for now.
13) If (or when ever) you have completed "[QT5087 Winterfall Runners]", go west to Donova Snowden ([G31,45], #11 on map) and turn it in. SKIP "High Chief Winterfall" (although this can be done if you can find a group). You can accept this, but my guide will not tell you to do it.
14) Follow the main path east to Everlook. 
15) Just to your left as you enter Everlook (next to the hut) turn in "[QT5163 Are We There, Yeti?]" ([G61,38]). Then complete "[QT8798 A Yeti of Your Own]".
16) From Felnok Steelspring under the blue tent ([G62,39]), accept "[QA4809 Chillwind Horns]".
17) Back in Everlook by the cage ([G62,38]), accept "[QA969 Luck Be With You]" (Elite) and "[QA5054 Ursius of the Shardtooth]" (Elite).
18) Go in the Inn and make Everlook your new home from the Innkeeper ([G61,39]). Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
19) Go south to Frostwhisper Gorge (entrance at [G59,64]) and start working on "[QC969 Luck Be With You]" (Elite): loot Frostmaul Shards.  Just try to distract the giants to loot the shards. Try to sneak in and take as much as you can, you can return here later to get more.
20) Hearth to Everlook.
21) Go just north of Everlook on the mountain slopes (starting at [G61,33]) and do "[QC5054 Ursius of the Shardtooth]" (Elite): keep grinding on mobs while working north along the mountain slopes and then kill Ursius /target (lvl 56 Elite bear) when he shows up. See map for his patrol path.
22) Go back to Everlook, by the cage ([G62,38]), and turn in (if its done) "[QT969 Luck Be With You]", then accept and turn in "[QT975 Cache of Mau'ari]". Also turn in "[QT5054 Ursius of the Shardtooth]", accept "[QA5055 Brumeran of the Chillwind]" (Elite). NOTE: The Cache of Mau'ari allows you to turn in E'kos for a temporary stat boost as long as the item remains in your bags.
23) Go south (starting around [G55,47]) and do "[QC5055 Brumeran of the Chillwind]" (Elite): kill Brumeran /target (lvl 58 Elite Chimera). See map for his patrol path.
24) If you need to, finish "[QC969 Luck Be With You]": go south to Frostwhisper Gorge (entrance at [G59,64], #5 on map) and loot Frostmaul Shards. Distract the elite giants and sneak in to loot the shards.
25) Go east to the Owl Wing Thicket (entrance at [G64,60]) and do "[QC4741 Wild Guardians]": kill Moontouched Owlbeasts. While questing here you might find an called Blue-feathered Necklace, which starts "[QA4882 Guarding Secrets]", accept it.
26) Once your Hearthstone cooldown is less than 5 minutes (keep grinding on owls until then), go back to Everlook (Don't Hearth) and back by the cage, turn in "[QT5055 Brumeran of the Chillwind]", SKIP "Shy-Rotam" (Elite), although you could do this if you can find help. Also, turn in (if you still need to) "[QT969 Luck Be With You]".
27) Exit Everlook to your right and go to the Wind Rider Master ([G60,36]) and fly to Bloodvenom Post, Felwood.
28) At Bloodvenom Post, turn in "[QT4741 Wild Guardians]", accept the next [QA4721 part]. Also turn in (if you found the item) "[QT4882 Guarding Secrets]", accept the next [QA4883 part].
29) Hearth to Everlook. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
30) Go north of Everlook (around [G65,21]) and do "[QC4883 Wild Guardians]": kill 10 Berserk Owlbeasts.
31) Just west of you do "[QC4809 Chillwind Horns]": kill/loot Chillwind Ravagers. Once finished, keep grinding until your Hearthstone cooldown is less than 11 minutes.
32) Die on purpose to get back to Everlook.
33) Go to the Wind Rider Master ([G60,36]) and fly to Bloodvenom Post, Felwood.
34) At Bloodvenom Post, turn in "[QT4883 Wild Guardians]". Also turn in (if you found the item and still need to) "[QT4882 Guarding Secrets]", accept the next [QA4883 part].
35) At Bloodvenom Post, go to the Wind Rider Master ([G34,54] in Felwood) and fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore.
36) Once at TB, go to The Elder Rise to Nara Wildmane and turn in "[QT4883 Guarding Secrets]" ([G76,32]).
37) Hearth to Everlook. Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
38) In Everlook, from Felnok Steelspring under the blue tent ([G62,39]), turn in "[QT4809 Chillwind Horns]", accept "[QA4810 Return to Tinkee]". NOTE: You can turn this in next time you head to Burning Steppes.
39) At this point you should be very close to level 60. I usually grind the rest of the way to level 60 at the Owl Wing Thicket (entrance at [G64,60], #1 on map). But here is a list of other things you could do instead of the owl grinding:
Here are the things you can do to level from 59-60:
--> You can go back into Eastern Plaguelands and do the many group quests that you couldn't solo.
--> You can grind away at mobs in Andorhal to increase your rep with The Argent Dawn.
--> You can grind away at Deadwood furbolgs up north in Felwood to gain rep with the Timbermaw.
--> You can do Black Rock Depths Instance and all the quests associated with it.
--> You can also do Stratholme Instance and all the quests associated with that.
--> You can simply grind on any mob you like until you hit 60.
